<span class="reduce">The Wire-Devil</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">C</span>ONNOLLY, off-trick division despatcher,
doubling on the early night trick for Jenner,
whose baby was sick, snapped his key-switch at
the close of a rapid fire of orders sent to straighten
out a freight-train tangle on the Magdalene district,
sat back in his chair, and reached for his
corn-cob pipe with a fat man’s sigh of relief.</p>

<p>Over in the corner of the bare, dingy office, Bolton,
night man on the car-record wire, was rattling
away at his type-writer; and on the wall opposite
the despatcher’s table the electrically timed standard
clock was ticking off the minutes between
eight-fifty-five and nine. While Connolly was
striking a match to light his pipe, Bolton tore the
type-written sheet out of his machine and twisted
himself in his chair to ask a question.</p>

<p>“What’s the good word from the Apache
Limited?” he inquired, his evil little eyes blinking
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>indecently. And then, before Connolly could reply:
“It’s up to me to ‘buy’ for the boys to-night.
My little girl-doll is comin’ on the Apache. Whadda
you know about that: chasin’ me all the way
from little old New York.”</p>

<p>The fat despatcher knew precisely where the
Limited was, but he glanced at his train-sheet from
sheer force of habit.</p>

<p>“On time at Angels, double-heading with the
Nine-thirteen, and the Six-five,” he said. Then
he shifted over to the car-record man’s cause for
jubilation. “I didn’t know you were a married
man, Bolton. If I ever get out of the woods and
make good on the job, I’m going to do it myself.”</p>

<p>Bolton’s mouth widened like a split in a parchment
mask, and his laugh was a dry cackle.</p>

<p>“Married&mdash;that’s a bully good joke. I’ll have
to tell it to the little doll-girl, when she comes.”</p>

<p>Connolly was Irish chiefly by virtue of his name.
He entirely missed the pointing of the car-record
man’s remark, but the apparent gibe touched his
vanity and his round and naturally ruddy face
grew a shade darker.</p>

<p>“Meaning that no girl with half a chance at
other fellows would look twice at a fat slouch like
me? That’s where you’re off your trolley. There
is one, Barry, and she’s pretty enough to make a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>wooden-Indian cigar-sign get down from his block
and chase her up the street for another look-in.
But I’ve got to make good and pull down a wad,
first.”</p>

<p>The car-record man’s laugh this time was an
unchaste sneer.</p>

<p>“Aw, chuck it!” he derided. “Whadda you
want to tie yourself up for when there’s plenty
of&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Say, that’ll do,” Connolly broke in, with a
frown of cleanly disgust, taking Bolton’s meaning
at last. Then he changed the subject abruptly.
“Mr. Maxwell’s got him a new chum: seen him?”</p>

<p>Bolton nodded.</p>

<p>“Sure, I have; couldn’t help seein’ him if you
happened to look his way. What is he?&mdash;champion
All-America heavy-weight?”</p>

<p>The despatcher shook his head. “College professor,
somebody said; one of Mr. Maxwell’s
classmates. Specializes in something or other;
I didn’t hear what.”</p>

<p>Again the tag-wire operator’s laugh crackled
like a snapping of dry twigs. He had risen from
his chair and was half-sitting, half-leaning, upon
his table-desk, his hands resting palms down, with
the fingers curled under the table edge&mdash;his
characteristic loafing attitude.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span></p>

<p>“He might specialize in any old thing,” he
jeered, with a small man’s bickering hostility for
a big one in his tone. “All he’s got to do is to
reach out and take it; nobody but a fellow in the
Joe Gans class’d have the nerve to tell him not to.
I saw him sittin’ on the Topaz porch with the
super as I came over. He’s so big it made me sick
at my stomach to look at him.”</p>

<p>Connolly’s pipe had gone out, burned out, and
he was feeling in his pockets for the tobacco sack.
While he was doing it the corridor door opened
and Calmaine, the superintendent’s chief clerk,
came in, let himself briskly through the gate in
the counter railing, and leaned over Connolly’s
shoulder to glance at the train-sheet.</p>

<p>“Everything moving along all right, Dan?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“Is now,” said the despatcher, still feeling absently
for the missing tobacco sack. “Twenty-one
and Twenty-eight got balled up on their orders
over on the other side of the range, but I guess I’ve
got ’em straightened out, after so long a time....
Now what the dickens did I do with that tobacco
of mine, I wonder?”</p>

<p>“Have a cigar,” said the chief clerk, laying one
on the glass-topped wire-table. Calmaine, eastern
trunk-line bred, had been inclined to cockiness
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>when he came West, but a year with Maxwell,
whose standing was that of the Short Line’s best-beloved
tyrant, had taken a good deal of it out of
him.</p>

<p>“Thanks,” returned Connolly, with a fat man’s
grin, “not for me when I’m despatching trains.
The corn-cob goes with the job. Sit in here on
the wire for a minute while I go up to the bunk-room
and look in my other coat.”</p>

<p>Calmaine took the vacated chair and ran his eye
along the latest additions to the many columns of
figures on the train-sheet. Bolton in his far corner
was still loafing, though his night’s work of
taking and typing the wire car reports from the
various stations on the double division was scarcely
begun. “You think you’re a little tin god on
wheels, don’t you?” he muttered under his breath,
blinking and scowling across at the well-groomed
young man sitting in Connolly’s chair. “You can
let down with Dan Connolly all right, but when it
comes to throwin’ a bone to the other new dog,
you ain’t it. One o’ these times I’m goin’ to jump
up and bite you.”</p>

<p>The object of this splenetic outburst was still
bending over the train-sheet, abstractedly unconscious
of Bolton’s presence. From the conductors’
room beyond the wire office three or four trainmen
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>drifted in to look over the bulletin-board notices;
and still Connolly did not return.</p>

<p>Suddenly the sounder in front of the substitute
set up a furious chatter, clicking out a monotonous
repetition of the “G.S.” call, breaking at intervals
with the signature “Ag,” the code letters for
Angels, the desert-edge town from which the
Apache Limited had been last reported. Calmaine
flicked his key-switch and cut in quickly
with the answering signal. Then, reaching for
pad and pen, he wrote out the message that came
boiling over the wire.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="no-indent">“G.S.</p>

<p>“Apache Limited in ditch at Lobo Cut four miles
west. Both engines crumpled up. Two enginemen,
one route agent, under wreck. Everything
off but rear Pullman. Train on fire and lot of
passengers pinned down. Hurry help quick.</p>

<p class="no-indent right2">“<span class="smcap">Ag.</span>”</p></div>

<p>Calmaine was an alert young man, well abreast
of his job and altogether capable. But before he
could yelp twice Connolly had come in, and it was
the fat despatcher who gave the alarm.</p>

<p>“My Lord, Bolton&mdash;see here!” he shouted,
pushing Calmaine aside as an incumbrance. And
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>then, when the car-record man came over to stare
vacantly at the fateful message: “Get a move!
Send somebody after Mr. Maxwell, quick! Then
get busy on that yard wire and turn out the wrecking
crew. Get Dawson on the ’phone and tell him
I’ll have a clear track for him by the time his
wreck-wagons are ready! Jump at it, man! Your
wife isn’t the only one that’s needing help! <i>Wake
up!</i>”</p>

<p>Over on the sidewalk loggia porch of the Hotel
Topaz fronting the electric-lighted railroad plaza,
Maxwell, the division superintendent, was sitting
out the evening with a broad-shouldered, solidly
built young man whose big frame, clear gray eyes,
and fighting jaw were the outward presentments
of a foot-ball “back” rather than those of the traditional
college professor.</p>

<p>“I don’t mind piping myself off to you, Dick,
though the full size of my job isn’t generally
known,” the athletic-looking stop-over guest was
saying. “You got the first part of it right; I’m
down on the Department of Agriculture pay-rolls
as a chemistry sharp. But outside of that I’ve half
a dozen little hobbies which they let me ride now
and then. You’ll guess what one of them is when
I tell you that I was the man who fried out the
evidence in the post-office cases last winter.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>
<p>“What!” exclaimed Maxwell. “But your name
didn’t appear.”</p>

<p>The big man with the smooth-shaven, boyish
face smiled contentedly.</p>

<p>“My name never appears. That is the high
card in the game. So far as that goes, I never
mess or meddle in the police details. My part
of the job is always and only the theoretical stunt.
They come to me and I tell ’em what to do. And
just about half the time they haven’t the least idea
why they are doing it.”</p>

<p>“Say, Calvin; that interests me a lot more than
you know,” was the young superintendent’s eager
comment. “I wish you didn’t have to go on to
the coast to-morrow morning. We’ve developed
an original little Chinese puzzle of our own here
in the Timanyoni that is pretty nearly driving
the last one of us wild-eyed. If you could stop
over&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The interruption came in the shape of a one-armed
man with a lantern, sprinting like a base-runner
across from the railroad building to the
hotel. It was the night watchman summoned by
the despatcher, and ten seconds later he had delivered
his message.</p>

<p>“The Lord have mercy!” gasped the superintendent,
bounding out of his chair, “the Limited?&mdash;in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>the ditch and on fire, you say? For Heaven’s
sake, where?”</p>

<p>“’Tis at Lobo Cut; ’tis Angels reporting it, sorr,
so Misther Connolly did be saying. He’s clearing
f’r the wreck-train now, and he axed would you be
coming over.”</p>

<p>“Tell him I’ll be over in a minute or two: as
soon as I’ve called up the hospital and turned out
the doctors.”</p>

<p>“Yis, sorr; but Misther Bolton’s doing that
same now. They do be saying his wife’s on the
train, and he’s <i>that</i> near crazy.”</p>

<p>Maxwell turned to his guest.</p>

<p>“You see how it is with us poor railroad devils,
Calvin. It’s a bad case of ‘have to,’ and I know
you’ll excuse me. Just the same, it’s an infernal
outrage&mdash;when we haven’t been able to get together
for a dog’s age.”</p>

<p>The chemistry sharp, as he had called himself,
was standing up and stretching his arms over his
head like a pole-vaulter hardening his muscles for
the jump.</p>

<p>“I’ll trot over to your shop with you, Dick, if
you don’t object,” he said good-naturedly. “I
want to see what happens when you get a hurry
call like this.”</p>

<p>In the despatcher’s office Connolly was hammering
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>at his key like a madman, with the sweat running
down his full-moon face and the hand which
was not in use shaking as if the left half of him had
been ague-smitten. Trainmen were coming and
going, and the alarm whistle at the shops was bellowing
the wreck call at ten-second intervals. Everybody
made way for Maxwell when he pushed through
the counter gate with his big guest at his heels.</p>

<p>“Any more news, Dan?”</p>

<p>The despatcher flicked his closing switch, and
immediately the ague spread to the hand which
was no longer steadied on the key.</p>

<p>“Nothing. I’ve been clearing, and everything
is getting out of the way. I’ve tried twice to get
Angels, but I can’t raise anybody. I guess Garner,
the operator, has set his signals at block and
gone to gather up what help he can find.”</p>

<p>Just then more men came crowding in from the
corridor, and one of them, a small man with hot
eyes and a harsh voice, barked at Connolly.</p>

<p>“Orders for the wreck-wagons, Dan; we’re
ready to go.”</p>

<p>Out of the throng behind the counter barrier
Bolton, yellow-faced and ghastly, fought his way
to the gate and besought the superintendent.</p>

<p>“Let me go, too, Mr. Maxwell!” he panted.
“My God! I’ve got to go!”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span></p>
<p>“Of course, you shall go, Barry,” said the superintendent
with quick kindliness, remembering
what the watchman had said about Bolton’s wife
being on the ditched train. “Dan, send the caller
after Catherton and let him take Bolton’s wire.”
Then he turned to his guest, who had been standing
aside and looking on with a level-eyed gaze
that lost no detail. “It’s hello and good-by for
us, Sprague, old man; that is, unless you’d care
to go along?”</p>

<p>The guest decided instantly. “I was just about
to ask you if you couldn’t count me in,” he returned;
and together they followed the rough-tongued
little conductor in a hurried dash for the
platform.</p>

<p>The wrecking-train had been backed down to the
station spur to take on the hospital car, and it was
standing ready for the eastward flight; two flat-cars
loaded with blocking and tackle, a desert
tank-car filled with water, two work-train boxes
crowded to the doors with men, and, next to the
engine, which was one of the big “Pacific types”
used on the fast mail runs, a heavy steam crane
powerful enough to lift a locomotive and swing it
clear at a single hitch.</p>

<p>“Who’s pulling us, Blacklock?” Maxwell asked,
overtaking the little man with the hot eyes.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>
<p>“Young Cargill.”</p>

<p>Maxwell turned to Sprague.</p>

<p>“I’m going on the engine, Calvin. There’s
room for you if you care to try it. If you don’t,
I’ll turn you over to Dawson, our master mechanic,
and he’ll make you at home in the doctors’ car.”</p>

<p>“I guess I’m in for all of it,” was the even-toned
reply, and they ran forward to climb to the
cab of the big mail flyer.</p>

<p>“My friend, Mr. Sprague, Cargill,” snapped
Maxwell, introducing the stranger to the handsome
young fellow in overalls and jumper perched upon
the high right-hand seat, and Cargill pulled off his
glove to shake hands.</p>

<p>“You’ll find the Ten-sixteen a pretty hard
rider,” he began; but Maxwell cut him short.</p>

<p>“You have a clear track, and Blacklock’s got
your orders. Open her up and see what you can
do. It’s a plain case of ‘get there’ to-night,
Billy. The minutes may mean just so many lives
saved or lost.”</p>

<p>“<i>’Right!</i>” yelled the fireman, leaning from the
gangway to get Blacklock’s signal; and at the
word the engineer’s hand shot to the lever, the
great engine shook itself free, and the rescue race
was begun.</p>

<p>For the first few miles of the race the track was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>measurably straight. Maxwell stood on the raised
step at Sprague’s elbow, steadying himself with a
grip on the sill of the opened side window. When
he saw that the ex-fullback was making hard work
of it he shouted in the big man’s ear.</p>

<p>“Loosen up a bit and take the roll with her,”
he advised, and Sprague nodded and tried it.</p>

<p>“That’s much better,” he called back. “What
are we making now?”</p>

<p>“Forty, or a little more. She’s good for sixty,
and so is Cargill, but the tangents are too short to
let us hit the limit.”</p>

<p>“And the wreck&mdash;how far away is it?”</p>

<p>“An hour and forty-five minutes from Brewster,
on a passenger schedule. We’ll better that by
ten or fifteen minutes, though.”</p>

<p>Evidently young Cargill meant to better it if he
could. At Tabor Mine, ten miles out, the big
engine’s exhaust had become a continuous roaring
blast, and the tiny station at the mine siding
flashed through the beam of the electric headlight
like some living thing in full flight to the rear. At
Kensett, where the line skirts the reservoir lake
of the Timanyoni High Line Irrigation Company,
they passed a long freight on the siding; the caboose
was only a few yards inside of the clear post,
and Sprague winced involuntarily when the engine
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>cab shot past the freight’s rear end with what
seemed only an inch or two to spare.</p>

<p>Corona was the next night telegraph station,
and here the wrecking special met the two following
sections of the freight drawn out upon the sidings
to right and left. Cargill’s grip closed upon
the throttle when the switch and station lights
swept into view; but the station semaphore was
wigwagging the “clear” signal, and once more the
big man on the fireman’s box sat tight while the
flying special roared through the narrow main line
alley left by the two side-tracked freights.</p>

<p>Maxwell was holding his watch in his hand when
the special cleared the switches at Corona and the
great beam of the headlight began to flick to right
and left in the dodging race among the foot-hills.</p>

<p>“Well make Timanyoni, at the mouth of the
canyon, in ten minutes’ better time than our fast
mail makes it,” he said to Sprague; and the
Government man nodded grimly.</p>

<p>“It’s all right, Dick,” he shouted back. “Just
the same, I’d like to know how a man ever acquires
the nerve to send a train around the hill corners
this way when he hasn’t the slightest notion of
what may be waiting for him five hundred yards
in the future.”</p>

<p>Apparently the stalwart young fellow on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>opposite side of the cab owned the necessary
nerve. Easing the huge flyer skilfully around the
sharpest of the turnings, he drove it to the limit
on the tangents in spurts that seemed to promise
certain destruction at the next crooking of the
track. But the wheels of the train were still
shrilling safely on the steel when the headlight
beam, playing steadily for the moment, brought the
lonely station at the canyon’s mouth into its field.</p>

<p>Cargill was whistling peremptorily for the signal
before the short train had fully straightened itself
on the tangent below the station. But for some
reason the red light on the station semaphore remained
inert. Instantly the sweating fireman
jerked his fire-door open, and the four pairs of eyes
in the flyer’s cab were all fixed upon the motionless
red dot over the track when Cargill sounded his
second call.</p>

<p>While the whistle echoes were still yelling in the
surrounding hills the climax came. Out of the
station door darted a man with a red lantern. Cargill
pounced upon the throttle, and in the same
second the brakes went into the emergency notch
with a jerk that flung the superintendent and the
fireman against the boiler-head and slammed the
guest unceremoniously into the cab corner.</p>

<p>At the shriek of the brakes, the man with the red
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>lantern turned and ran in the opposite direction,
waving his signal light frantically; and the wrecking
special was still only shrilling and skidding to
its stop when a long passenger-train drawn by two
engines slid smoothly out of the canyon portal and
came grinding down the grade with fire spurting
from every suddenly clipped wheel-rim.</p>

<p>Thanks to the man with the red lantern, there
were half a dozen car-lengths to spare between the
two trains when the double stop was made. But
Maxwell was swearing hotly when, with Sprague
for a close second, he dropped from the step of the
panting 1016 and ran to meet the conductor of the
passenger-train in the middle of the scant safety
distance. Like the superintendent, the conductor
was also boiling over with profanity, but he swallowed
the cursing portion of his wrath hastily
when he recognized the “big boss.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s you, is it, Mr. Maxwell?” he blurted
out. “By hen! I was getting ready to cuss somebody
out, red-hot! What’s the trouble?”</p>

<p>“There doesn’t seem to be any,” snapped Maxwell
shortly. “Is this the Limited?”</p>

<p>“Sure it is,” replied the conductor. “Hadn’t
it ought to be?”</p>

<p>“And you haven’t been in the ditch?”</p>

<p>The big red-faced train captain grinned.</p>

<p class="caption">Thanks to the man with the red lantern, there were half a<br />
dozen car-lengths to spare between the two trains.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>

<p>“Not that anybody’s heard of. Is that what’s
the matter? Was you coming to pick us up?”</p>

<p>Maxwell’s answer was a barked-out string of
orders.</p>

<p>“Let these wreck-wagons in on the siding.
Find Blacklock and tell him to get orders to follow
you to Brewster as second section. Pull out
as quick as you can. You’re ten minutes off time,
right now!”</p>

<p>In the drawing-room of the rear sleeper of the
limited, Maxwell closed the door on his guest and
himself, passed his cigar-case, lighted a fresh cigar
in his own behalf, and said nothing until after the
short shifting stunt had been worked out and the
Apache Limited was once more racing on its way
westward. Then he opened up.</p>

<p>“You’ve got it now, Calvin; the thing that has
been smashing more nerves for us than we can
afford to lose. Of course, you understand what
has happened. That blood-curdling report of an
accident was a fake wire; God only knows where
it came from, or who sent it.”</p>

<p>“And there have been others?” queried Sprague.</p>

<p>“A dozen of them, first and last. It began
about a month ago. Sometimes it’s merely foolish;
at other times it’s like this&mdash;a thing to bring
your heart into your mouth.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span></p>
<p>“And you mean to say you haven’t been able to
run it down?”</p>

<p>“Run it down? If there is anything we haven’t
done it’s some little item that has been merely
overlooked. We’ve had about all of the company
detectives here, first and last, and the best of them
have had to give it up. There is nothing to work
on; absolutely nothing. This wire to-night purported
to come from Angels; as a matter of fact,
it may have come from anywhere east of Brewster
and this side of Copah. When we come to
examine the Angels operator, we’ll probably find
that he doesn’t know a thing about it&mdash;not a
thing in the wide world.”</p>

<p>“Yet it was a real wire?”</p>

<p>“Calmaine, my own chief clerk, took it from
the sounder and wrote it down. It seems that
Connolly, the night despatcher, had gone out for
a moment and Calmaine was holding down the
wires for him. I saw the message before we left.
The call and signature were all right, and the exact
time, nine-thirteen, was given.”</p>

<p>“Wire-tappers?” suggested the listener, who
had grown shrewdly sympathetic.</p>

<p>“That is what we’ve all thought. But to tap
a wire, you have to cut in on it somewhere. Of
course, it could be done in any one of a thousand
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>isolated places, but hardly without leaving some
trace. Wickert, our wire-chief, has been over the
lines east and west with a magnifying-glass, you
might say.”</p>

<p>For the measuring of a few other miles of the
westward flight of the train the big man in the
opposite seat said nothing. Then he began again.</p>

<p>“Have you tried to figure out a motive, Dick?”</p>

<p>“That is precisely what is driving every one of
us stark, staring mad, Calvin,” was the sober confession.
“There isn’t any motive&mdash;there can’t
be!”</p>

<p>“No trouble with the labor unions?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit in the world. More than that, the
men have spent good money of their own trying to
help us find out&mdash;as a measure of self-protection.
You can see what they’re afraid of; what we are
all afraid of. Everybody is losing nerve, and if
the scare keeps up, we’ll have real trouble&mdash;plenty
of it.”</p>

<p>“And you say the source of the thing can’t be
localized?”</p>

<p>“No. We have a double division, with Brewster
as the common head-quarters. Sometimes
the yelp comes from the east, and sometimes from
the west.”</p>

<p>Again the big-bodied chemistry expert sank back
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>in his seat and fell into the thoughtful trance.
When he came out of it, it was to say:</p>

<p>“You’ve probably settled it for yourself that it
isn’t a plant for a train robbery&mdash;the kind of
robbery which would be made easier by a wreck.”</p>

<p>Maxwell shook his head.</p>

<p>“A pile of cross-ties would be much simpler.”</p>

<p>“Doubtless. We’ll cancel that and come to
the next hypothesis. Could it be the work of
some crazy telegraph operator?”</p>

<p>“We’ve threshed out the crazy guess. It
doesn’t prove up. A madman would slip up now
and then&mdash;trip himself. I have a file of the fake
messages. They were not sent by a lunatic.”</p>

<p>“Call it another cancellation,” said the guest.
“You are convinced that some sane person is doing
it. Very good. What is the object? You
say you can’t find out; which merely means that
you’ve been attacking it from the wrong angle.
Or, rather, you’ve let the professional detectives
give you their angle. What you need is a bit of
first-class amateur work.”</p>

<p>The superintendent laughed mirthlessly. “If
I could only find the amateur I’d hire him, Calvin,&mdash;if
it took a year’s salary. I don’t know what
the wire-devil’s object is, but I can catalogue the
results. These periodical scares are demoralizing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>the entire Short Line. The service is on the
ragged edge of a chaotic blow-up. Half the men
in the train crews are running on their bare
nerves, and the operators who have to handle
train-orders are not much better.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the guest quietly. “I’ve been
noticing. I saw only one man in your office who
wasn’t scared stiff; and the conductor of this train
we’re riding on had a pretty bad attack of the
tremolos when you told him what the wrecking-train
was out for.”</p>

<p>“Who, Garrighan? No, you’re mistaken there.
He’s one of the cold-blooded ones,” said the superintendent
confidently.</p>

<p>“Excuse me, Dick; I’m never mistaken on that
side of the fence. There were signs, plenty of
them. Ninety-eight men in every hundred will
duck and put up one or both arms if you strike
at them suddenly. Garrighan did neither, you’ll
say; but if you had been watching him as closely
as I was, you would have seen that he started to
do both.”</p>

<p>Maxwell was regarding his former classmate
curiously.</p>

<p>“Is that how you do it? Is that the way you
caught the post-office thieves, Calvin?”</p>

<p>The chemistry expert laughed.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span></p>
<p>“It’s only a little pointer on methods,” he
averred. “When my attention was first called
to such things&mdash;it was on a case in the Department
of Justice in which I was required to give expert
testimony&mdash;I was very strongly impressed with the
crudities of the ordinary detective methods. I
said to myself that what was needed was some one
who could apply good, careful laboratory practice;
a habit of observation which counts nothing too
small to be weighed and measured.”</p>

<p>“Go on,” said Maxwell.</p>

<p>“The idea came to me that I’d like to try it on,
and I did. My theory is correct. Human beings
react under certain given conditions just as
readily, and just as inevitably, as the inorganic
substances react in a laboratory experiment.”</p>

<p>Maxwell reached for the box of safety matches
and passed it to Sprague, whose cigar had gone out.</p>

<p>“I wish you could stay and put this railroad of
ours into your test-tube, Calvin. We’re teetering
along on the edge of an earthquake&mdash;oh, yes&mdash;I
know you’ll say it’s only a scare; but the worst
panic that has ever gone into history was only a
scare in the beginning. One of these fine nights
some engineer or some operator with the bare
nerves will lose his grip. You know about what
that will mean. We’ve escaped alive, so far;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>but the first real wreck that hits us will be just
about the same as dropping a lighted match into
a barrel of gunpowder; I thought it had come to-night;
I’m glad it hasn’t, but I know it’s only
postponed.”</p>

<p>The chemistry man nodded.</p>

<p>“Somebody is reaching for you with a big stick;
that is very evident, Maxwell. And there are
brains behind it, too, when you come to think of
it. If you wanted to kill a man without getting
hanged for murder, one way to do it would be to
persuade him to commit suicide. Has it ever occurred
to you that somebody may be trying the
same experiment on your railroad?”</p>

<p>“Good Lord, no!”</p>

<p>“Stranger things have happened. But that is
beside the mark. You say you are needing help.
I’ve half a mind to stop off and give you a bit of
a lift.”</p>

<p>“By Jove, Calvin!&mdash;if you would&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Call it a go,” interrupted the guest. “I’ll
take a chance and say that my business in San
Francisco can wait a few days. The fellow I’m
after out there won’t run away; it’s the one thing
he doesn’t dare to do.”</p>

<p>“Say, old man! but that’s bully of you!” exclaimed
the host, reaching across to grip the hand
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>of helping. “You shall have everything in sight;
I’ll put every man on the two divisions under your
orders, and you can have a special train and my
private car. If you don’t see what you want, just
ask&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The chemistry sharp was holding up his hand
and laughing.</p>

<p>“No, no; hold on, Dick. You’ll have to let me
tackle the thing in my own way, and there won’t
be any grand-stand plays in it&mdash;in fact, I don’t
mean to appear personally in it at all. Let’s see
where we stand. You have a division detective of
some sort, haven’t you?&mdash;a fellow who does the
gun-play act when it becomes necessary?”</p>

<p>“We have; a young fellow named Archer Tarbell,
who got his experience chasing cattle thieves
in Montana. He’s a fine fellow, and it’s breaking
his heart because he can’t get the nippers on our
wire-devil.”</p>

<p>“All right. I may want to use him. Now another
matter. You have a live newspaper in
Brewster; I bought a copy of it on the train this
morning. If I remember right, it’s called <i>The
Tribune</i>. Is it friendly to your railroad?”</p>

<p>“Ordinarily, yes; though Treadwell, the owner,
is independent enough to print anything that he
thinks is news.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span></p>

<p>“Know him pretty well?”</p>

<p>“Very well, indeed.”</p>

<p>“Good. When we get in, make it your first
care to see the newspaper people and to persuade
them not to make any mention of this little miss-go
of to-night. That’s the first move and it’s an
important one. Can you work it?”</p>

<p>“Sure. But I don’t see the point.”</p>

<p>“Never mind about that; I probably sha’n’t do
anything that you think I ought to do. Now about
this man Tarbell; is he known as a company detective?”</p>

<p>“No, not generally known; he’s on the pay-roll
as a spare operator&mdash;relief man, you know.”</p>

<p>“That’s better. When I meet him I’ll see if I
can’t get him interested in chemistry. That’s
how you’re going to account for me, you know.
I’m an old friend of yours, a Government man out
of the Department of Agriculture off on a vacation.
Incidentally, I might be wanting to buy a
mine, or something of that sort&mdash;anything to start
the town gossip on a harmless chase and to keep it
as far as possible from the real reason for my stop-over.”</p>

<p>“Everything goes,” said Maxwell. “I’ll start
the gossip. What else?”</p>

<p>“Nothing out of the ordinary. I shall ask you
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>to give me the run of your railroad office, and I’d
like to meet anybody and everybody, when it falls
in naturally&mdash;but always as the chemistry sharp;
get that well ground into your cosmos. But here&mdash;what’s
this? Are we already back in Brewster?”</p>

<p>“We are,” said the superintendent, with a
glance out of the window. Then he became the
regretful host again. “I hate to have you go back
to the hotel, Calvin. It’s just my crooked luck
to have you come along when the house is shut up
and Mrs. Maxwell and the babies are out of town.
They’re due to come home in a day or two, and
I’m selfish enough to hope that we can keep you
over. Let’s drop off here at the crossing. It’s
nearer to the hotel, and it’ll give me a chance to
reach <i>The Tribune</i> office before Treadwell’s young
men come in with their scare stuff.”</p>

<p>It was a half-hour after the arrival of the unwrecked
Limited, and the story of the curious false
alarm was just getting itself passed from lip to
ear among the loungers in the Hotel Topaz lobby,
when the Government man came down from his
room to file a rather lengthy New York message
with the hotel telegraph operator.</p>

<p>“Cipher?&mdash;holy smoke!” exclaimed the young
man at the lobby wire desk; but a liberal tip made
it look easier, and he added: “All right, I’m good
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>for it, I guess, and I’ll get it through as quick as
I can. Answer to your room?”</p>

<p>“If you please,” said the guest; and, as it was by
this time well on toward midnight, he went to bed.</p>

<p>By noon of the day following the false alarm run
of the wrecking-train to Timanyoni Canyon, all
Brewster, or at least the railroad part of it, knew
that Superintendent Maxwell was entertaining
an old college classmate at the Hotel Topaz. For
the town portion of the gossip there was some little
disagreement as to Mr. Calvin Sprague’s state
and standing. Some had it that the big, handsome
athlete was a foot-ball coach taking his vacation
between seasons. Others said that he was a capitalist
in disguise, looking for a ground-floor investment
in Timanyoni mines.</p>

<p>These were Mr. Sprague’s placings for the man
in the street. But to the rank and file in the railroad
head-quarters building Sprague figured in his
proper character as a Government drug-mixer on
a holiday; a royal good fellow who fraternized instantly
with everybody, whose naïve ignorance
about railroading was a joke, and whose vast unknowledge
was nicely balanced by a keen and comradely
curiosity to learn all that anybody could tell
him about the complex workings of a railroad head-quarters
in action.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span></p>

<p>Naturally, and possibly because Davis, the chief
despatcher, was willing to be hospitable, he spent
an hour of the forenoon in the wire office, ingenuously
absorbing detail and evincing an interest in
the day’s work that made Davis, ordinarily a
rather reticent man, transform himself into a
lecturer on the theory and practice of railway
telegraphy.</p>

<p>It was in Davis’s office that he met Tarbell; and
the keen-eyed, sober-faced young fellow who was
carried on the division pay-rolls as a relief operator
became his guide on a walking tour of the shops and
the yards. Tarbell saw in Mr. Maxwell’s guest
nothing more than an exceedingly affable gentleman
with an immense capacity for interesting
himself in the workaday details of a railroad outfit;
but at one o’clock, when Maxwell joined
Sprague at a quiet corner table for two in the
hotel café, there were several surprises awaiting
the superintendent.</p>

<p>“Getting it shaken down a little so that you’ll
know where to begin?” was Maxwell’s opening
question; and the ex-fullback laughed.</p>

<p>“You must take me for a sleuth of the common
or garden variety,” he retorted. “Did you suppose
I had thrown away an entire forenoon scoring
for a start? Not so, Richard; not even remotely
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>so. I’ve been finding out a lot of things.
I am even able to suggest an improvement or two
in your telegraph installation.”</p>

<p>“For example?” said Maxwell.</p>

<p>“Both of your yard offices are cut in on the
working wire. If this were my railroad I’d put
them on a pony circuit and cut them out of the
main line.”</p>

<p>“Why would you?”</p>

<p>“We’ll have to go back a little for the specific
answer in the present case; back to last night,
and to the young man who chased out with a red
lantern to keep us from running into the passenger
train which wasn’t wrecked. Why do you suppose
he did that?”</p>

<p>“That’s easy; he heard the passenger coming
down the canyon.”</p>

<p>“That was the inference, of course. But when
you have taken the thirty-third degree in the exact
science of observation, Dick, you’ll learn to distrust
inferences and to accept only conclusions.
He didn’t hear the passenger; he didn’t know it
was coming. If you had been observing him as
closely as I was, you would have seen him write
this down in his actions as plain as print. He had
a much better reason for stopping us&mdash;and the
passenger. It was a wire order from somebody.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>If you don’t believe it, have Davis call him up and
ask him, when you go back to your office.”</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the criticism just passed upon
him by his table-mate, Maxwell again caught at an
inference.</p>

<p>“You’ve found the wire-devil, Calvin? You’ve
got to the bottom of the thing in a single forenoon?”</p>

<p>“No; not quite to the bottom. But some few
things I have learned, beyond any question of
doubt. In the first place, this trouble of yours is
pretty serious; far more serious than you suspect.
In fact, it is designed to remove your railroad from
the map, not by murder outright, but by what you
might call incited suicide. The condition which
you described last night is painfully apparent,
even to an outsider like myself. Half of your men
are potential powder-mines, ready to blow up if
the spark is applied.”</p>

<p>“Go on,” said Maxwell eagerly. “What else
did you find out?”</p>

<p>“I learned that a stop-all-trains order was sent
to your young man at the canyon station last
night, and that, in all probability, it was sent from
Brewster. The ultimate question fines itself down
to this: did your night despatcher, Connolly, send
that order through his own instrument in his own
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>office? or did he, or some other, send it from the
upper yard office?&mdash;which, as I have remarked,
is rather injudiciously cut in on the regular
working wire. I’ll venture to make the answer
positive; the order was sent from the yard
office.”</p>

<p>“Connolly!” said the superintendent under his
breath. “I can’t believe it, Calvin. Who ever
heard of a fat villain?”</p>

<p>“Go a little easy on the inferences,” laughed the
chemistry expert. “I didn’t say it was Connolly,
though it looks rather bad for him at the present
stage of the game. He is in debt, and he wants to
get married.”</p>

<p>“But, good Lord! what has that got to do
with&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hold on,” interposed the expert calmly. “We
haven’t come to that part of it yet. As I say, this
stop-order was sent from the yard office. How do
I know? Because the sender left his trail behind
him in the shape of a wire recently cut and recoupled&mdash;the
cutout being made to keep the message
from repeating itself in the head-quarters
office where it might be heard by anybody who
happened to be standing around.”</p>

<p>“But Connolly couldn’t leave his wire to go to
the yard office.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span></p>
<p>“Unfortunately for him, he did leave it. About
half an hour after the wrecking-train left he called
Davis, who was sleeping in one of the bunk-rooms
in your wickiup attic. His excuse was that he was
so rattled that he couldn’t hold himself down at
the train-desk. Davis relieved him for an hour
or so, and then he came back.”</p>

<p>“Still I can’t believe it of Connolly,” Maxwell
persisted. “If he sent that message to Timanyoni
last night, that makes him responsible for all the
others&mdash;the devil-messages, as the men are calling
them. Some of these have come in the night,
while he was on duty. How could he have
worked it in that case?”</p>

<p>Again the chemistry expert laughed. “A suspicious
person might draw a bunch of inferences,”
he said, “throwing out a dark hint or so about a
concealed cut-in on the wires after they enter the
attic of the railroad building and a hidden set of
instruments. Also, the same person would probably
point to the fact that Connolly wasn’t at his
desk when the fake wreck notice came last night.
It was your chief clerk, Calmaine, who took it
from the wire, and he tells me he was subbing for
Connolly for a few minutes while Connolly went
upstairs for his smoking-tobacco.”</p>

<p>“My Lord!” said Maxwell; “you’ve put it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>upon Connolly, fair and square, Calvin; it’s all
over but the hanging!”</p>

<p>“There you go again,” joked the Government
man, with his good-natured grin. “I haven’t said
it is Connolly. But I will say this: with another
half-day at it, I’ll probably be able to turn the
case over to Tarbell&mdash;and the newspapers.”</p>

<p>“The newspapers?”</p>

<p>“Yes. That will be a part of the cure for the
crazy sickness among your men. Sit tight and
say nothing, and by this evening I’ll be ready to
put you next.”</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon, and the man from
Washington had spent much of the intervening
time loafing in the different offices sheltered by the
head-quarters roof, when young Tarbell got a telephone
summons from the hotel. In the writing-room,
which was otherwise deserted, he found the
superintendent’s guest waiting for him. Sprague
waved him to a chair and began at once.</p>

<p>“What did you find out, Mr. Tarbell?”</p>

<p>“Nothing to hurt. The fellow you was askin’
about went out on the wreck-train and came back
on it.”</p>

<p>“You’re sure of that?”</p>

<p>“Sure of the first part, and not so sure of the
last. I’ve found half a dozen o’ the men who saw
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>him get on the train here, and saw him after he was
on. They’re a little hazy about the back trip, but
he must’ve come back that way, because he didn’t
come on the Limited.”</p>

<p>“And his wife?”</p>

<p>Tarbell’s lip curled in honest cleanliness.</p>

<p>“He ain’t got any wife. It was his girl he was
expectin’, and she didn’t come.”</p>

<p>“And afterward?” suggested the questioner.</p>

<p>“After he got back he showed up in the office
and took his job again, lettin’ Catherton go home.”</p>

<p>The Government man’s eyes narrowed and after
a moment he began again.</p>

<p>“How near can you come to keeping your
own counsel, Mr. Tarbell?” he demanded abruptly.</p>

<p>“I reckon I can talk a few without sayin’ much,”
said the ex-cowboy. And then, after a pause:
“You mean that you don’t want to be mixed up
in this thing by name, Mr. Sprague?”</p>

<p>“You’ve hit it exactly. You’ve got your start
and I want you to work it out yourself. You have
the line. Somebody&mdash;somebody who is not a
thousand miles from your head-quarters building
over yonder&mdash;is working this scare, working it for
a purpose which he wishes to accomplish without
making himself actually and legally responsible.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>Had you got that far in your own reasoning, Mr.
Tarbell?”</p>

<p>“No, indeedy,” was the prompt reply. “I
reckon I’m only a plug when it comes down to the
sure-enough, fine-haired part of it.”</p>

<p>“You’ll learn, after a bit,” said the chemistry
expert shortly. “But let that go. You have the
facts now, and they are driven pretty well into a
corner. Can you go and get your man?”</p>

<p>Tarbell got up and shoved his hands into his
pockets.</p>

<p>“I reckon I can,” he admitted slowly, and
started to move away. But at the door the big
man at the writing-desk recalled him.</p>

<p>“Don’t go on supposition, Tarbell. Ask yourself,
when you get outside, if you’ve got the evidence
that the court will demand. Ask yourself,
also, if you know of your own knowledge, or if
you’ve only allowed yourself to be hypnotized into
your belief. If you can get satisfactory answers
to these questions, go to it and bring back the
money, as they say up in Seattle.”</p>

<p>For what remained of the afternoon after Tarbell
went away, Sprague sat in the writing-room
and wrote letters, sealing and addressing the last
one just as Maxwell came over to go to dinner with
him. At table there were plenty of uncut back-numbers
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>in the way of college reminiscences to be
threshed over, and Sprague carefully kept the talk
in this innocuous field until after they had left the
dining-room to go for a smoke on the loggia porch.
When the cigars were alight, Maxwell would no
longer be choked off.</p>

<p>“Anything new in the wire-devil business, Calvin?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“I’ve turned the case over to Tarbell, as I promised.
I’m through with my part of it.”</p>

<p>“What’s that!” ejaculated the superintendent.
“You’ve got your man?”</p>

<p>“Tarbell will get him&mdash;most probably before
we go to bed to-night. He’s a fine young fellow,
that reformed cowboy of yours, Dick. I like
him.”</p>

<p>Maxwell was still gasping. “You’re a wonder,
Calvin&mdash;a latter-day wizard! Good Heavens!
Do you realize that we’ve been working on this
thing for a month? And you’ve cleaned it up in
a day!”</p>

<p>The chemistry expert was smiling good-naturedly.</p>

<p>“Perhaps I came at a fortuitous moment, and
had exceptional advantages,” he demurred.</p>

<p>“But are you sure?” demanded Maxwell soberly.</p>

<p>“So sure that if your ‘devil’ had caused any loss
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>of life in his monkeyings, I could go into court and
hang him.”</p>

<p>“Thank God!” said the superintendent; and
then again, as if an enormous weight had been
lifted from his shoulders, “Thank God!”</p>

<p>Sprague looked up quickly.</p>

<p>“You’ve been taking it pretty hard, haven’t
you, Dick? Any special reason?”</p>

<p>“Yes. You know Ford, our president: he has
made the Pacific Southwestern System&mdash;made it
out of whole cloth; and, incidentally, he has made
a good few of us fellows who have fought with him
shoulder to shoulder from the first. When I was
last in New York, a couple of months ago, he rode
from the club to the station in the taxi with me.
He was in trouble of some sort&mdash;he didn’t tell me
what it was; but the last thing he said as I was
boarding the train gave me some notion of it.
‘Run that jerk-water Short Line of yours, Dick,
as if you were carrying all your eggs to market
and had them all in one basket,’ he said, and then
he added: ‘No wrecks, Dick, if you have to sit up
nights to head them off.’”</p>

<p>Sprague was smoking peacefully. It was perhaps
too much to expect that a man whose problems
were chiefly in the field of laboratory science
should be very deeply interested in one in which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>the elements were merely human. When he spoke
again it was to recur to his favorable impression
of Tarbell. “I like that young fellow,” he said
in conclusion. “He’ll pull you out of the hole&mdash;with
a little timely help from the newspapers.
When he gets the ball into his hands and starts
down the field with it, you’d best be prepared for
some pretty sensational developments. They’re
due.”</p>

<p>For a little while Maxwell said nothing, and the
fine lines between his eyes deepened slowly into a
frown of anxiety. Finally he said: “I’ve got
’em, too, Calvin&mdash;the ‘jimmies,’ I mean. My
wife and the two kiddies are coming home on the
‘Apache’ to-night, and don’t you know, I had half
a mind to wire her to stop over in Copah until I
could go after her? That’s a pretty pass for things
to come to, isn’t it?&mdash;when a man’s afraid to have
the members of his family ride over his own particular
piece of railroad?”</p>

<p>Sprague flipped the ash from his cigar.</p>

<p>“That’s one of the bridges you don’t have to
cross until you come to it.”</p>

<p>Maxwell got out of his chair and refused
Sprague’s offer of a fresh cigar.</p>

<p>“No,” he said; “this has been one of the days
when I’ve smoked too much. I’m going over to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>the office to keep my finger on the pulse of things.
When it gets too dull for you over here, come across
and break in. If I’m not in my own office, you’ll
find me in room eleven&mdash;the despatcher’s&mdash;keeping
tab on the movements of the Apache Limited.”</p>

<p>Fully two hours beyond the time when the superintendent
had crossed the railroad plaza to climb
the stair of the head-quarters building, Tarbell,
strolling along the plaza-fronting street, swung
himself over the railing of the loggia porch and
took the chair next to the man from Washington,
who was still sitting as Maxwell had left him and
still smoking.</p>

<p>“I’ve been waiting for you,” said the patient
smoker, without taking his eyes from the row
of lighted windows in the railroad building opposite.</p>

<p>“I allowed you would be,” rejoined Tarbell in
his gentle Tennessee-mountain drawl. And then,
quite as calmly: “I reckon I’ve found the answers
to all them questions you ’lotted to me. I reckon
I’ve got him.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been betting on you, Tarbell,” was the
word of approval. Then: “It comes pretty near
home, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“It sure does. It’s goin’ to hurt Mr. Maxwell
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>good and plenty. He counts all the men in the
home office as his fam’ly, and there’s never been
one o’ them to go back on him till now.”</p>

<p>“What is your evidence?” queried Sprague.</p>

<p>“I reckon you’d call it circumstantial&mdash;and so
will the judge. But it hobbles him all right.
There’s a cut-in on the despatcher’s wires over
yonder, ’way up under the roof where nobody’d
find it, with four little fine lead wires goin’ down
in the wall. I couldn’t find where they come out
at, but I reckon that don’t make any difference:
they’re <i>there</i>.”</p>

<p>“Anything else?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I’ve got a letter that I hooked out of his
coat pocket not ten minutes ago; a letter from
some gang boss o’ his’n in New York, givin’ him
goss for not showin’ up results, and allowin’ to
pull some sort of a gun on him if the papers don’t
begin to print scare heads about a certain railroad
management, <i>pronto</i>.”</p>

<p>The chemistry expert smiled shrewdly.</p>

<p>“You are not the young man I took you for,
Tarbell, if you are not wringing your brain like a
wet towel to make it tell you why anybody in New
York should wish to see Nevada Short Line wreck
bulletins in the newspapers.”</p>

<p>“That ain’t no joke, neither,” Tarbell admitted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>gravely, adding, “I been hopin’ maybe it would
come out in the round-up.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Sprague, half-absently. “It will
come out in the round-up.” And then, after a
thoughtful pause, “Perhaps we’d better go over
and relieve Mr. Maxwell’s mind. But first it
wouldn’t be a bad idea to telephone the editor of
<i>The Tribune</i> and ask him to send his railroad reporter
down to Mr. Maxwell’s office. If you say
that Mr. Maxwell will probably have a bit of first-page
stuff for him, it won’t be necessary to go into
details.”</p>

<p>Tarbell went into the hotel lobby to telephone,
and afterward they crossed the plaza to the
working head-quarters of the double division.
Finding the superintendent’s office open and
lighted but unoccupied, they went on to the despatcher’s
room. In the public space outside of
the counter railing three or four trainmen were
grouped in front of the bulletin-board looking for
their assignments on the night trains and thumbing
the file of posted “General Orders.”</p>

<p>Behind the railing Connolly was sitting at his
glass-topped wire-table with the train-sheet under
his hand and the superintendent at his elbow.
Over in the corner under his green-shaded electric
bulb, Bolton, the sallow-faced car-record man, was
fingering the keys of his type-writer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span></p>

<p>Tarbell opened the gate in the railing to admit
Sprague and himself. Maxwell looked up and
nodded a welcome to his guest.</p>

<p>“Got tired of sitting it out alone, did you?” he
said; and then, “I’ll be with you in a minute and
we’ll go over to my office. I’m waiting to get
Timanyoni’s report of the Limited.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Maxwell is on the train?”</p>

<p>Maxwell nodded, and a moment later Connolly’s
sounder clicked out Timanyoni’s report of the passing
train. The fat despatcher was nervous. It
showed in his rattling of the key as he O K’d the
canyon station’s report, and again in a small disaster
when, in reaching for his pen to make the
train-sheet entry, he overset his ink-well.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m damned!” he grunted, snatching at
the train-sheet and pushing the ink flood back
with his free hand. Maxwell came to the rescue,
and so did Tarbell; and a liberal application of
blotters stopped the flood. But at the close of the
incident Connolly’s hands were well blackened.</p>

<p>It was at this conjuncture that Davis, the chief
despatcher, came in on the way up to his room in
the attic half-story above. Connolly appealed to
him at once.</p>

<p>“If you’ll sit in here, just for a minute, Davis,
while I go wash my hands?” he said, adding:
“I’d ought to be kicked all the way downstairs!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span></p>

<p>When Davis had taken the chair and Connolly
had gone out, Tarbell whispered to the superintendent.
Maxwell nodded, and made a sign to
Sprague. When he had closed the door of the
despatcher’s room behind himself and his guest,
he explained:</p>

<p>“Tarbell says he is ready, and we may as well
have it over with. Do you want to be present?”</p>

<p>“As a spectator, yes,” said the expert.</p>

<p>“All right; we’ll go to my office and wait for
Archer.”</p>

<p>The waiting interval proved to be short. Maxwell
had just thrown his roll-top desk open, and
the Government man had planted his big bulk
solidly in the half-shadowed window-seat, when
the door opened and Connolly came in, his full-moon
face a frightened blank and his hands still
ink-blackened. Tarbell was only a step behind
the despatcher, and the reporter from <i>The Tribune</i>
office was at Tarbell’s heels. When the three were
inside, Tarbell shut the door and put his back
against it.</p>

<p>“Here’s your man, Mr. Maxwell,” he said
briefly; and Sprague, who had started to his feet
at the door opening, sat down again in the shadow
and said nothing.</p>

<p>Maxwell pointed brusquely to a chair at the desk
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>end. “Sit down, Dan,” he snapped. And then:
“I suppose you know what you’re here for?”</p>

<p>Connolly fell into the chair as if the sharp command
had been a blow.</p>

<p>“Know what I’m here for?” he stammered.</p>

<p>“Yes. Nothing will be gained by dodging.
You may as well make a clean breast of it. You’ve
been faking these scare wreck reports&mdash;don’t lie
about it; we’ve got the evidence. I want to
know who is behind you. Who bribed you to do
this thing?”</p>

<p>“Before God, Mr. Maxwell!” the culprit began,
with the sweat rolling down his face; but Maxwell
stopped him with a quick gesture.</p>

<p>“I’ve told you it was no use to try to lie out of
it. I have here on my desk a letter which was
taken from your coat pocket to-night, since you
came on duty; a letter from which you were careful
enough to tear the signature, but on which you
were not careful enough to destroy the date line.
In that letter the writer threatens to give you away
to the New York police if you don’t get busy and
give the newspapers a string of Nevada Short Line
wrecks to write about. That is enough to send
you over the road, but there’s more. The working
wires east and west have been cut under the roof
of this building, and leads taken off. The leads
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>disappear in the wall back of your bunk-room. I
don’t ask you what you have to say for yourself;
I want you to tell us, right here and now, who
planned the thing, and what it was intended to
accomplish.”</p>

<p>Connolly had been slowly collapsing in his
chair under the merciless fire of accusation, and
a pasty pallor was driving the pink out of his
round face.</p>

<p>“My God!” he gasped thickly; and then he
repeated, “My God!” A silence crammed with
threatenings settled down upon the small office-room.
Suddenly it was broken by the sound of
hurried footfalls in the corridor, and Tarbell was
hurled half-way across the room when the door was
flung open from without.</p>

<p>It was young Cargill, the engineer, who burst
into the private office, and his lips were white.</p>

<p>“The Limited!” he broke out. “She’s overrun
her orders at Corona and she’s due to meet Second
Eighteen on the single track!”</p>

<p>It was the Government man who led the rush to
the despatcher’s room, a rush in which even the
fat culprit joined. In the wire office Davis had
the key; his jaw was set and the perspiration was
standing thickly on his forehead, but he had not
lost his nerve. Calmaine, the chief clerk, was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>hanging over his shoulder, and outside of the railing
the group of trainmen had grown to a breathless
crowd, pressing to hear the latest word.</p>

<p>When Maxwell’s party pushed through the gate,
Sprague was still in the lead, and his quick glance
took in every detail of the scene. Like a flash he
turned upon Tarbell, who was fumbling a pair of
handcuffs in his pocket, and pinioned him in a
grip that was like the nip of a vice.</p>

<p>“Not yet!” he whispered in Tarbell’s ear; and
then Davis snapped his switch and spoke.</p>

<p>“It’s no use,” he said, and his harsh tone was
only a thin mask for the break in his voice. “It’s
the real thing this time. First Eighteen was ready
to pull out of Corona when the Limited went by.
Corringer left his wire and chased the freight, hoping
to get its engine to cut loose and run after the
passenger. He couldn’t catch it.”</p>

<p>A low murmur ran through the crowd packed
against the counter railing and somebody whispered,
“It’s got the boss; his wife and babies are on
that train. Look at him!”</p>

<p>Maxwell had gripped the back of a chair and he
was staring hot-eyed at the despatcher.</p>

<p>“Do something, Davis,” he pleaded. “Don’t
sit there and let those trains come together! For
Christ’s sake, think of something!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span></p>

<p>The chief despatcher ducked his head as if he
were dodging a blow and swallowed hard.</p>

<p>“There isn’t anything to do, Mr. Maxwell&mdash;you
know there isn’t anything,” he began in low tones.
“If there was&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>It was Connolly who made the break. Twisting
away from Tarbell’s grip on his arm he flung himself
upon Davis.</p>

<p>“Get out o’ that chair and let me have the key,”
he wheezed; and when Davis did not move quickly
enough he pounced upon the key standing. Davis
got up and quietly slid the chair under the night
man who sank heavily into it without missing a
letter in the call he was insistently clicking out,
over and over again in endless repetition.</p>

<p>“What is it?” whispered the newspaper man,
who was standing aside with Tarbell and Sprague;
and Tarbell answered:</p>

<p>“It’s the Corcoran coal mine&mdash;about half-way
between Corona and the first station this side,
and a half-mile up the gulch. They’ve got a private
wire, but they ain’t got any night operator.”</p>

<p>Davis overheard the whisper and shook his head.</p>

<p>“Dan’s got his wits with him,” he said, in open
admiration. “There’s a young time-keeper that
sleeps in the coal company’s office shack, and he’s
learning to plug in on the wire a little. If Dan
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>can only wake him&mdash;&mdash;” And then, in sudden
sharp self-accusation: “God forgive me! why
didn’t I think of it and save all the time that’s
been wasted?” Then, as Connolly closed the circuit
and a halting reply clicked through the receiving
instrument: “He’s got him! Thank the Lord,
he’s got him! If he can only make him understand
what’s wanted, there’s a chance&mdash;just one
chance in a thousand!”</p>

<p>With the very seconds now freighted with disaster,
and with only the crudest of amateur telegraphers
at the other end of the wire, nine men out
of ten would have blown up and lost the thousandth
part of a chance remaining. But Connolly
was the tenth man. With his left hand shaking
until it was beating a tattoo on the glass table
top he hitched his chair closer and began to spell
out, letter by letter, the brief call for help upon
which so much depended. Tarbell translated for
Sprague, word by word. “Hurry&mdash;down&mdash;to&mdash;main-line&mdash;and&mdash;throw&mdash;your&mdash;switch&mdash;to&mdash;red.
Then&mdash;run&mdash;west&mdash;and&mdash;flag&mdash;passenger.”</p>

<p>The key-switch clicked on the final word, and
for five long, dragging seconds the silence was a
keen agony. Then the sounder began hesitantly:
dot&mdash;pause&mdash;dot; dash&mdash;dot&mdash;dash, it spelled;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>and Tarbell translated under his breath, “He says
‘O K’. Now, if he can only chase his feet fast
enough&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>How Maxwell managed to live and not die
through the interminable twenty minutes that followed;
how Davis and Tarbell and Connolly hung
breathless over the wire-table, while the throng
outside of the railing, augmented now to a jammed
crowd of sympathetic watchers, rustled and moved
and whispered in awed undertones&mdash;are themes
upon which the rank and file of the Nevada Short
Line still enlarge in the roundhouse tool-rooms
and in the switch shanties when the crews are waiting
for a delayed train.</p>

<p>The dreadful interval seemed as if it would
never be outworn, but the end came at last when
the hesitant clicking of the sounder was resumed.</p>

<p>“Call it out, Dan,” shouted somebody among
the waiting trainmen, and Connolly pronounced
the words slowly as the amateur at the end of the
private wire ticked them off.</p>

<p>“Both&mdash;trains&mdash;safe&mdash;freight&mdash;backing&mdash;to&mdash;blind&mdash;siding&mdash;at&mdash;Quentin&mdash;switch&mdash;passenger&mdash;following&mdash;under&mdash;flag.”</p>

<p>A shout went up that drowned the feeble patter
of the telegraph instruments and made the windows
rattle. “Bully for the kid at the coal mine!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>“Bully for Danny Connolly!” “Come out here,
Danny, till we get a chanst at you!”</p>

<p>Maxwell fought his way stubbornly through the
crowd, with the newspaper man, Sprague, Tarbell,
and Connolly following in his wake. When the
five were once more behind the closed door of the
private office across the hall, the superintendent
turned morosely upon the night despatcher, and
he was so full of the thing he was about to do that
he did not notice that his guest had taken Tarbell
aside for a whispered conference.</p>

<p>“You’ve drawn the teeth of the law, this time,
Connolly,” he said sharply. “After what you’ve
just done I’m not going to send you to jail. But
the least you can do is to tell me who hired you
and sent you out here to make trouble for us. If
you’ll do that&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>It was Sprague’s hand on his shoulder that
stopped him, and then he noticed that Tarbell had
disappeared. “Just a minute&mdash;until Tarbell gets
back,” said the guest, in low tones; and while he
was saying it, the door opened suddenly and the ex-cowboy
returned, thrusting a sallow-faced young
fellow, shirt-sleeved and livid with fear, into the
office ahead of him. Then the Government man
went on in the same low tone, “You can say to
this young man all the things you were going to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>say to Mr. Connolly. There was a little miscue on
Tarbell’s part, and I was just going to tell you
about it when the train trouble butted in.” Then
to the fat despatcher, “Mr. Connolly, sit down.
You’ve jolly well earned the right to look on and
listen.”</p>

<p>Connolly sat down heavily, and so did the superintendent.
Thereupon the man from Washington
slipped easily into the breach, turning briskly
upon the yellow-faced car-record operator.</p>

<p>“Step up here, Bolton, and make a clean sweep
of it to Mr. Maxwell. Tell him how a certain firm
of New York brokers&mdash;you needn’t give the names
now&mdash;sent you, a convicted bucket-shop wire-tapper,
out here to disarrange things on this railroad
for stock-jobbing purposes. Then tell him
how you tapped the despatcher’s wires and put a
set of concealed keys under your car-record table
in the other room. Tell him how, after you’d
faked that wreck message last night, you ran a
bluff for sympathy, and how, when it had worked,
your nerve flickered and you dropped from the
wrecking-train in the yard and sent a stop-order
from the yard office. Come to the front and
loosen up!”</p>

<p>Bolton was shuffling forward and was beginning
a tremulous confession when Maxwell stopped him
harshly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span></p>

<p>“You can keep all that to tell in court!” he
snapped. And then to Tarbell: “Take him away,
Archer. And you go back to your job, Dan, and
let Davis go to bed. What I’ve got to say to you
will keep.” Then to the young man from the
<i>Tribune</i>, who had his note-book out and was
scribbling down his story at breakneck speed:
“Write out what you please, Scanlan, but tell Mr.
Kendall that I’ll be up to the office presently, and
that I’d like to see the story before it goes to the
linotypes.”</p>

<p>When the room was cleared, the snappy little
superintendent spun his chair around to face his
guest.</p>

<p>“Calvin,” he said solemnly, “you’ll never know
how near you came to making me break my heart
to-night. If I’d had to send Dan Connolly to jail
after what he did in the other room a little while
ago&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The chemistry expert was grinning joyously.</p>

<p>“It was a curious little slip,” he commented.
“I thought Tarbell was on; never suspected for a
moment that he wasn’t until he butted Connolly
in here and shot him at you.”</p>

<p>“But you knew Connolly wasn’t the man?
How on top of earth did you run it down, in a
single day? I can’t surround it, even yet.”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t much of a nut to crack,” laughed the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>expert easily. “I hope you’ll have a harder one
for me the next time I happen along. I got my
pointer last night&mdash;before I knew anything at all
about the nature of your trouble. You see, Bolton
was the only man in the outfit who wasn’t
sincerely jarred and horrified by that fake message.
I saw it the minute I’d had a look into his eyes.
From that on it was easy enough.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see it,” objected Maxwell.</p>

<p>“Don’t you? I merely argued backward from
the results your wire-devil was trying to obtain
and sent a cipher message to a friend of mine in
New York. He put me next to a nice little plot
in the Street to hamper Ford and break down your
company credit. Then I loafed around your
shack here until I found Bolton’s wire machinery.
Bolton didn’t catch on, but he was suspicious
enough of a stranger like me to take a little measure
of precaution by slipping that incriminating letter
into Connolly’s coat pocket. I supposed Tarbell
knew that, or I’d have told him.”</p>

<p>Maxwell had been listening in appreciative admiration,
but gratitude came quickly to the fore
when Sprague paused.</p>

<p>“Calvin, there’s no telling how many lives
you’ve saved by this little stop-over of yours here
in Timanyoni Park!” he broke out. “You’ve
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>done it. When that story, properly trimmed down,
comes out in the <i>Tribune</i> to-morrow morning, the
bare-nerves strain will go off like that”&mdash;snapping
his fingers. “I wish I could show you.... By
George! there’s the Limited pulling in. I’ve got to
go down and meet the wife and kiddies!”</p>

<p>The big-bodied man who called himself a chemistry
sharp and confessed to the riding of many
hobbies rose up with a laugh.</p>

<p>“You want to show me? All right: take me
downstairs with you and show me Mrs. Maxwell
and the babies. As for the other, you know as
well as I do that it’s all in the day’s work. Pitch
out or we’ll miss the folks&mdash;and that would be
worse than getting another message from the
wire-devil.”</p>

<span class="reduce">High Finance in Cromarty Gulch</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">I</span>T was a warm night for altitude five thousand
feet, and the last few lingerers in the dining-car
on the eastbound “Flying Plainsman” had
their windows open. Midway of the car a quartette
of light-hearted young people were exchanging
guesses as to the proper classification of a big
man with laughing eyes and a fighting jaw who
was dining alone at one of the end tables.</p>

<p>“He looks like money&mdash;nice, large, ready money&mdash;to
me,” commented the prettiest of the three
young women; but her seat-mate, a handsome
young fellow with the badge of his college athletic
association worn conspicuously in his button-hole,
thought differently. “You’ve fumbled the ball
this time, Kitty,” he dissented. “If he isn’t the
champion of all the amateur heavy-weights, you
can put him down as a ’varsity coach out scouting
for talent. Jehu! what a ‘back’ he’d make under
the new rules!”</p>

<p>“Vaudeville is my guess,” chimed in the next-to-the-prettiest
girl mockingly; “the strong man
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>who puts up the dumb-bells, and all that, you know.
If you could break into his luggage, I’d wager a
box of chocolates that you’d find a perfectly beautiful
suit of pink tights with spangled trunks and
resined slippers.”</p>

<p>A little later the big man in the far corner took
his change from the waiter and left the car. As
he passed the joyous party at the double table
there was a good-natured twinkle in his gray eyes
and he dropped a neatly engraved card at the
collegian’s plate.</p>

<p>“Heavens and earth!&mdash;he heard us!” gasped the
prettiest girl. And then, feminine curiosity overcoming
shame, “What does it say, Tommy?”</p>

<p>The young man held the card so that all could
see, and admitted himself a loser in the classification
game.</p>

<p class="center no-indent"><span class="smcap">Calvin W. Sprague</span>,<br />
Washington, D. C.<br />
<i>Chemist, Dept. of Agriculture</i></p>

<p class="no-indent">was what they read; and the fourth member of the
group, a young woman with fine eyes and an
adorable chin, who was neither pretty nor prettier,
but something far more transcendent, took the
card and studied it thoughtfully.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span></p>
<p>“You’ve all missed the most astonishing thing&mdash;how
he contrived to overhear us at this distance,”
she commented musingly. And then, addressing
the vanished card-owner through his bit of pasteboard:
“So you’re a chemist, are you, Mr.
Sprague? You don’t look it, not the least little
bit, and I’m sure you’ll forgive me if I say that I
doubt it; doubt it very much indeed.”</p>

<p>While the young people were debating among
themselves as to whether or no there might not be
an apology due, the big man who had dined alone
passed quite through the string of vestibuled Pullmans
and went to light his cigar on the rear platform
of the combination buffet and observation
car.</p>

<p>Shortly after he had seated himself in one of the
platform camp-chairs, the train, which had been
rocketing down a wide valley with an isolated
ridge on one hand and a huge mountain range on
the other, came to a stand at one of the few-and-far-between
stations. The pause, one would say,
should have been only momentary; but after it
had lasted for a full minute or more the solitary
smoker on the rear platform left his chair and went
to lean over the platform railing for a forward
glance.</p>

<p>Looking down the length of the long train, he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>saw the lights of the small station, with other lights
beyond it which seemed to mark a railroad crossing
or junction. On the station platform there
were a number of lanterns held high to light a
group of men who were struggling to lift a long,
ominous-looking box into the express-car.</p>

<p>A little later the wheels of the train began to
trundle again, and as his car-end passed the station
the smoker on the observation platform had a fleeting
glimpse of the funeral party, and of the heavy
four-mule mountain-wagon which had apparently
served as its single equipage. Also, he remarked
what a less observant person might have missed:
that the lantern-bearers were roughly clothed, and
that they were armed.</p>

<p>A hundred yards beyond the station the train
stopped again; and when it presently began to back
slowly the platform watcher understood that it was
preparing to take on a lighted coach standing on
a siding belonging to the junction railroad. When
the coupling was made and the “Flying Plainsman,”
with the picked-up car in tow, was once
more gathering headway in its eastward flight up
the valley of a torrenting mountain river, the big
man read the number “04” over the door of the
newly added coach. After he had made out the
number he coolly put a leg over the barrier railing,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>brushed the guarding porter aside, and pushed his
way through the narrow side corridor of the trailer.</p>

<p>In the rear half of the car the corridor opened
into a comfortable working-room fitted with easy-chairs,
lounges, and a desk; otherwise, the office
in transit of the Nevada Short Line’s general
superintendent, Mr. Richard Maxwell. Maxwell
was at his desk when the big-bodied intruder
shouldered himself into the open compartment,
but he sprang up joyfully when he recognized his
unannounced visitor.</p>

<p>“Why, Calvin, old man! Where in thunder did
you drop from?” he demanded, wringing the hand
of greeting in a vain endeavor to match the big
man’s crushing grip. “Sit down and tell it out.
I thought you’d gone back east over the Transcontinental
a full month ago.”</p>

<p>The man whose card named him as a Government
chemist picked out the easiest of the lounging-chairs
and planted himself comfortably in it.</p>

<p>“Jarred you, did I? That’s nothing; I’ve
jarred worse men than you are in my time. Your
thinking machinery is all right; I was due to go
back a month ago, but I got interested in a little
laboratory experiment on the coast and couldn’t
tear myself away. How are Mrs. Maxwell and
the kiddies?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span></p>
<p>“Fine! And I’m hurrying to get home to them.
I’ve been out for a week and had begun to think
I was never going to get back to the Brewster
office again. I’ve been having the busiest little
ghost dance you ever heard of during the past few
days.”</p>

<p>The big man settled himself still more comfortably
in his chair and relighted the cigar, which,
being of the dining-car brand, had sulked for a
time and then gone dejectedly out.</p>

<p>“Will the busy story bear telling?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;to you,” was the half-guarded reply.
“You’ll be interested when I tell you that I’m inclined
to believe that it’s ‘a little more of the same’&mdash;a
continuation of our round-up with the ‘wire-devil’
that you straightened out for us a few weeks
ago.”</p>

<p>The listener nodded. “Begin back a bit,” he
suggested; and Maxwell did it.</p>

<p>“After you went west, we put our wire-devil
through the courts, and President Ford served
notice on the New York high-finance pirates;
told them he had their numbers, and that they’d
better let up on us. That was the end of it for the
time. But a week ago Thursday I got a hot wire
from Ford, telling me to secure voting proxies on
every possible share of Short Line stock held
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>locally, firing the proxies to him in New York by
special messenger, who should reach him, he said,
not later than the night of the fifteenth.”</p>

<p>“Um,” commented the smoker thoughtfully.
“Is there much of the stock held out here in your
Timanyoni wilderness?”</p>

<p>“A good bit of it, first and last. When the
Pacific Southwestern, with Ford at its head, took
over the Red Butte Western, the R. B. W. was
strictly a local line, and the reorganization plan
was based upon an exchange of stock&mdash;the new for
the old. Then, when we built the extension and
issued more stock, quite a block of it was taken
up by local capitalists, bankers, mineowners, and
ranchmen; not a majority, of course, but a good,
healthy balance of power.”</p>

<p>Again the giant in the lounging-chair nodded.
“I see,” he cut in. “There is doubtless a stockholders’
meeting looming up in the near future&mdash;say
on the day after the all-important fifteenth&mdash;and
the Wall Street people are going after Ford’s
scalp again, this time in a strictly legal way. He
will probably need your Western proxies, and need
them bad.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got them right here,” said Maxwell, tapping
a thick bunch of papers on his desk. “And
believe me, I’ve had a sweet time rounding them
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>up. Every moneyed man in this country is a
friend of Ford’s, and yet I’ve had to wrestle with
every individual one of them for these proxies as
if I’d been asking them to shed their good red
blood.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” was the quiet comment. “The
fellows on the other side would stack the cards on
you&mdash;or try to. What’s in the wind this time?
Just a stock-breaking raid for speculation, or is it
something bigger than that?”</p>

<p>The young superintendent shook his head doubtfully.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, certainly; I haven’t had a chance
to talk with Ford since early in the summer. But
I have my own guess. If the Transcontinental
could control this five-hundred-mile stretch of ours
from Copah to Lorchi, it would have the short line
to southern California.”</p>

<p>“Therefore and wherefore, if Mr. Ford doesn’t
happen to have the votes in the coming stockholders’
meeting, you’ll be out of a job. Is that
about the size of it?”</p>

<p>“Probably,” admitted Maxwell. “Not that
it makes any special difference to me, personally.
As you know, I have a mine up on the Gloria that
beats railroading out of sight. But I’d fight like
a dog for Ford, and for my own rank and file here
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>on the Short Line. Of course, Transcontinental
control would mean a clean sweep of everybody:
there wouldn’t be baskets enough this side of the
main range to hold the heads that would be cut
off.”</p>

<p>“I suppose not. But, as you say, you have
the ‘come-back’ right there under your hand in
those proxies. How will you get them to New
York?”</p>

<p>“My chief clerk, Calmaine, will deliver them
in person. He’ll meet us at Brewster and go right
along on this train, which, by the way, is the next
to the last one he could take and make New York
on time. It’s all arranged.”</p>

<p>The guest smoked on in silence for a little time
and when he spoke again it was to ask the name of
the junction station at which the late stop had
been made.</p>

<p>“It’s Little Butte&mdash;where our Red Butte branch
comes in from the north.”</p>

<p>“You’d been stopping over there?” Sprague
asked.</p>

<p>“No; I had my car brought down from Red
Butte on the local, which doubles back on the
branch.”</p>

<p>“Um; Little Butte; good name. You people
out here run pretty persistently to ‘Buttes,’ don’t
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>you? Did I, or didn’t I, see a funeral at this particular
Butte as we came along?”</p>

<p>“You did. It’s Murtrie; a mining engineer
who has been doing a sort of weigh-master’s stunt
at the Molly Baldwin mine. Died pretty suddenly
last night, they say.”</p>

<p>“Large man?” queried the Government chemist,
half-absently; and Maxwell looked up quickly.</p>

<p>“Beefy rather than big, yes. How could you
tell?”</p>

<p>Sprague waved his cigar as if the question were
childish and the answer obvious. “It took a
dozen of them, more or less, to put him into the
express-car.”</p>

<p>Maxwell turned back to his desk. “Metallic
casket, probably,” he suggested. “They had our
agent wire Brewster for the best that could be had.
Said they were going to ship the body to some little
town in Kentucky. They’re a rather queer lot.”</p>

<p>“Who?&mdash;the Kentuckians?”</p>

<p>“No; the Molly Baldwin outfit. The mine was
opened by a syndicate of New York people four
years ago, and after the New Yorkers had put two
or three hundred thousand into it without taking
anything out, they gave up in disgust. Then a
couple of young fellows from Cripple Creek came
along and leased the property. There was a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>crooked deal somewhere, for the young fellows
began to take out pay&mdash;big pay&mdash;right from the
start. Then the New York people wanted to
‘renig’ on the lease, and dragged the thing into
the courts.”</p>

<p>“And the courts said no?”</p>

<p>“The courts straddled. I didn’t follow the fight
in detail, but the final decision was that the lessees
were to keep all they could take out each month
up to a certain amount. If they exceeded that
amount, the excess was to be shared equally with
the New Yorkers.”</p>

<p>“Lots of room for shenanigan in that,” was the
big man’s passing comment. “Unless these young
Cripple Creekers are more honest than the average,
they’ll stand a good bit of watching, you’d say.”</p>

<p>Maxwell laughed. “That was what the New
Yorkers seemed to think. They secured a court
order allowing them to put an expert of their own
on the job. And nobody seems to enjoy the
watch-dog stunt. They’ve had to send in a new
man every few weeks.”</p>

<p>“Do the Cripple Creekers kill them off?”</p>

<p>“No; they buy ’em off, I guess. Anyway, they
don’t stay. Murtrie was the last.”</p>

<p>“And apparently he hasn’t stayed,” said
Sprague reflectively; and just then a long-drawn
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>wail of the locomotive whistle announced the approach
of the train to Brewster. At the signal the
guest rose and tossed the remains of the bad cigar
out of the window. “Here’s where I have to quit
you, Dick,” he was beginning; but Maxwell would
not have it that way.</p>

<p>“Not much, you don’t, Calvin, old man,” he
protested. “You’re going to stop over one day
with me, at least. No; I won’t listen to any excuses.
Give me your berth check and I’ll send my
boy up ahead to get your traps out of the sleeper.
Sit down right where you are and take it easy.
You’ll find a box of cigars&mdash;real cigars&mdash;in this
lower drawer. I’ll be back as soon as I’ve seen
Calmaine.”</p>

<p>Apparently, the man from Washington did not
require much urging. He sat down in Maxwell’s
chair as the train was slowing into the division
station, and was rummaging in the desk drawer for
the box of cigars when an alert, carefully groomed
young man came in through the forward corridor
and met the superintendent as he was going out.
There was a hurried conference, a passing of
papers, and the two, Maxwell and his chief clerk,
went out together, leaving the big man to go on
with his rummaging alone.</p>

<p>Shortly afterward came the bump of a coupling
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>touch, and the office-car, in the grip of a switching-engine,
raced backward through the yards; backward
and forward again, and when it came to rest
it was standing on the short station spur at the end
of the railroad head-quarters building. From the
open windows Sprague could see the long through
train, with its two big mountain-pulling locomotives
coupled on, drawn up for its farther flight.
It was after it had steamed away into the night
that Maxwell returned to his side-tracked car to
find his guest, half-asleep, as it seemed, in the
depths of the big wicker easy-chair.</p>

<p>“I hope you didn’t think I’d deserted you,” he
said, drawing up another of the wicker chairs.
“I took time to telephone home. Mrs. Maxwell’s
dining out at her sister’s, and, if you don’t
mind, we’ll sit here a while and go out to the
house later.”</p>

<p>There was enough to talk about. The two, who
had been college classmates, had seen little of each
other for a number of years. Maxwell told how he
had gone into railroading under Ford, and how in
his first summer in the Timanyoni he had acquired
a gold mine and a wife. Sprague’s recounting
was less romantic. After leaving college he had
coached the ’varsity foot-ball team for two years
and had afterward gone in for original research in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>chemistry, which had been his “major” in college.
Later he had drifted into the Washington bureau
as an expert, taking the job, as he explained, because
it gave him time and frequent leisurely intervals
for the pursuit of his principal hobby, which
was the lifting of detective work to the plane of
pure theory, treating each case as a mathematical
problem to be demonstrated by logical reasoning.</p>

<p>“You ought to drop everything else and take
up the man-hunting business as a profession,”
laughed Maxwell, when the hour-long talk had
come around to the big man’s pet among the
hobbies.</p>

<p>“No,” was the instant objection. “That is
where you’re wrong. A man does his best work
as an amateur&mdash;in any line. As long as the man-hunting
comes in the way of a recreation, I enjoy
it keenly. But if I had to make a business of it,
it would be different.” Then he changed the subject
by asking about Tarbell, Maxwell’s ex-cowboy
division detective, who had served as his understudy
in the “wire-devil” case a few weeks earlier.</p>

<p>“Archer is all right,” was the reply; “only he’d
like to break away from me and go with you. He
thinks you are about the one only top-notcher;
says he’d like to take lessons of you for a year
or so.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span></p>
<p>Sprague was gazing absently out of the near-by
window. “Speaking of angels,” he broke in,
“there is Tarbell, right now; coming down your
office stair three steps at a jump,” and a moment
later the young man in question had dashed
across to the service-car and was thrusting his
face in at the open window.</p>

<p>“Trouble, Mr. Maxwell!” he blurted out.
“The ‘Plainsman’s’ just been held up and robbed
at Cromarty Gulch! Connolly’s getting the wire
from Corona, and he started me out to see if I
could find you.”</p>

<p>The superintendent leaped up as if his easy-chair
had been suddenly electrified.</p>

<p>“What’s that you say?” he demanded; “a
hold-up?” Then he went into action promptly, as
a trained emergency captain should. “Call Sheriff
Harding on the ’phone, and tell him to rustle up
a posse and report here, quick! Then get the yard
office and turn me out an engine and a coach for
Harding’s men. Hustle it!”</p>

<p>While he was closing his desk he made hurried
explanation to Sprague. “It’s probably the Scott
Weber gang. They held up a train on the main
line over in Utah ten days ago. Come on upstairs
with me and we’ll get the facts.”</p>

<p>When the superintendent, accompanied by his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>broad-shouldered guest, climbed the stair and
entered the despatched office, fat, round-faced
Daniel Connolly was rattling the key at the train-sheet
table. He glanced up at the door opening.</p>

<p>“I’m mighty glad Tarbell found you,” he broke
out, with a gasp of relief. “I was afraid you’d
gone home.” And then he recognized the square-shouldered
one: “How are you, Mr. Sprague?
Glad to see you again.”</p>

<p>Maxwell went quickly around to the wire-table.</p>

<p>“Whom have you got?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Allen, night operator at Corona. The train
is there, and I’ve been holding it to give you a
chance to talk with McCarty, the conductor.”</p>

<p>“Tell me the story as you’ve got it; then I’ll
tell you what to say to Mac,” was the brisk command.</p>

<p>“It was in Cromarty Gulch, just at the elbow
where the track makes the ‘U’ curve. Cruger’s
on the pilot-engine, and Jenkins is running the
train puller. Cruger saw somebody throwing a
red light at him. They stopped, and four of the
hold-ups climbed on the engines and made them
cut off the postal- and express-cars and pull on
around the curve. Then a bunch of ’em broke in
the end door of the express-car and scragged little
Johnny Galt, the messenger. While they were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>doing that, another bunch went through the train
and held up the passengers. After they’d gone
through Galt’s car and taken what they wanted,
they made Cruger and Jenkins couple up again and
go on.”</p>

<p>“What did they take?” Maxwell asked.</p>

<p>“Some little money and jewelry from the passengers,
McCarty says; not very much.”</p>

<p>“But from the express-car?”</p>

<p>The fat despatcher made a queer face and wiped
the sweat from his forehead.</p>

<p>“That’s the part of it that’s hard to believe.
Galt was carrying considerable money, but they
didn’t try to blow his safe. They&mdash;they smashed
up a coffin and took the dead man out of it.”</p>

<p>“What!” ejaculated the superintendent; “Murtrie’s
body?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know who it was&mdash;Mac didn’t say.
But that’s what they did. When the boys got together
and pulled Galt out from under the express
stuff where they’d buried him, they found the
coffin open and the body gone.”</p>

<p>Sprague had been listening intently.</p>

<p>“This seems to be something worth while, Maxwell,”
he cut in. “How much time do we have
to waste here?”</p>

<p>“Just a minute. Go on, Connolly.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span></p>
<p>“That’s all,” said the fat despatcher. “The
train’s at Corona now, and they’ve put Johnny
Galt off; and&mdash;and the coffin. Mac’s asking for
orders.”</p>

<p>“Give them their orders and let them go, and
then clear for my special. I’ve sent for Harding
and a posse, and we’ll chase out after this thing
while the trail is warm. You’ll go along, won’t
you, Calvin?” turning to the stop-over guest.</p>

<p>The man from Washington laughed genially.</p>

<p>“You couldn’t scare me off with a fire-hose&mdash;not
until I have seen this little mystery of yours
cleared up. Let’s be doing.”</p>

<p>Five minutes farther along the two-car special
train had been made up and was clanking out over
the switches in the eastern yard. As the last of
the switch-lights were flicking past the windows,
a big bearded man came in from the car ahead and
Maxwell introduced him.</p>

<p>“Sprague, this is Sheriff Harding. Harding,
shake hands with my friend, Mr. Sprague, of the
Department of Agriculture, Washington, and then
sit down and we’ll thrash this thing out. You’ve
heard the story?”</p>

<p>The sheriff nodded. “I’ve heard what Tarbell
could tell me. He says the biggest part of the haul
was a dead man. Is that right?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span></p>
<p>“It seems to be. The dead man is Murtrie, who
was supposed to be representing the New York
owners of the Molly Baldwin mine. The report
goes that he died last night, and his body was
put on the train at Little Butte to be taken east
to some little town in Kentucky. What’s your
guess?”</p>

<p>“I’d guess that the whole blamed outfit was
locoed&mdash;plumb locoed,” said Harding. “You
couldn’t carve it out any other way, could you?”</p>

<p>It was Sprague who broke in with a quiet suggestion.
“Try once more, Mr. Harding,” he said.</p>

<p>The big sheriff put his head in his hands and
made the effort. When he looked up again there
was the light of a new discovery in his eye.</p>

<p>“Say!” he exploded. “Murtrie’s the last of a
string of five or six ‘watchers’ they’ve had up at
that cussed hole-in-the-ground gold mine&mdash;and
he’s dead. By gravy! I believe they killed him!”</p>

<p>Maxwell’s smile was grim.</p>

<p>“It seems to me we’re just about as far off as
ever,” he commented; “unless you can carry it
along to the body-snatching in some way. Why
should they&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hold on,” Harding cut in; “I wasn’t through.
It’s one thing to kill a man, and another to get rid
of the body so it won’t show up and get somebody
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>hanged. Murtrie was sick; that much I know,
because Doc Strader went out to the mine to see
him day before yesterday. I was talking with
Strader about it, and he said it looked like a case
of ptomaine poisoning.”</p>

<p>“Well?” said Maxwell.</p>

<p>“Supposin’ it wasn’t natural; supposin’ it was
the other kind o’ poison: they’d have to get rid o’
the body, some way or other, wouldn’t they,&mdash;or
run the risk of havin’ it dug up and looked into,
after Murtrie’s friends took hold?”</p>

<p>“Go on.”</p>

<p>“That bein’ the case, they’d have to call in some
sort of outside help; they couldn’t handle it alone.
Two or three of Scott Weber’s gang’ve been seen
hanging around in Brewster within the last few
days. Supposin’ these fellows at the Molly Baldwin
put up a job with Scott to make this play with
Murtrie’s body?”</p>

<p>“By Jove, Harding&mdash;I half believe you’ve got
it!” Maxwell exclaimed; but the chemistry expert
said nothing.</p>

<p>“We can tell better after we get on the ground,
maybe,” the sheriff went on. “I had Follansbee
bring his dogs along. There’s a trail up through
the head of Cromarty Gulch leadin’ out to the old
Reservation road on the mesa. If they had anything
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>as heavy as Murtrie’s body to tote, that’s
about the way they went with it.”</p>

<p>Maxwell had been absently marking little
squares on his desk blotter as Harding talked.
The sheriff’s theory was ingenious, but it failed to
account for all the facts.</p>

<p>“There’s more to it than that,” he said, at
length. And then he appealed to the silent guest.
“Don’t you think so, Sprague?”</p>

<p>“I’m waiting to hear how Mr. Harding accounts
for the raid on the passengers,” said the big man
modestly. “One would think that a gang of
body-snatchers would have been willing to do one
thing at a time.”</p>

<p>“By George! that’s so,” the sheriff acknowledged.
“I hadn’t thought of that. But then,”
he added, after a second thought, “a gang that
was tryin’ to cover up a killin’ wouldn’t be any
too good to throw in a little hold-up business on
the side.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Sprague; but he made no further
comment. So far from it, he sat back in his chair
and smoked patiently while Maxwell and the
sheriff went on with the theory-building, a process
which continued in some desultory fashion until
Maxwell, glancing out of a window, said:</p>

<p>“We’re coming to it; this is the gulch.”</p>

<p>A few minutes later the two-car train slowed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>down and came to a stand on a sharp curve at the
head of a densely wooded ravine in the foot-hills.
Harding ran forward to get his posse out, and by
the time Maxwell and Sprague had debarked the
ground at the track-side was black with men.
Sprague laughed softly.</p>

<p>“It’s lucky we’re not depending upon the old
Indian method of ‘reading the sign,’” he said.
“Whatever the ground might have told us is a
story spoiled by this time.” Then he laughed
again when a man broke out of the crowd, with a
couple of dogs towing him furiously at the end of
their leashes. “We gabble a good bit about our
civilization and the advances we’ve made,” he
went on. “Yet, in the relatively simple matter
of running down a criminal, we haven’t got
very far beyond the methods of the Stone Age.
The idea of an intelligent being, with a human
brain to rely upon, falling back upon the instincts
of a couple of brute beasts!”</p>

<p>“Oh, hold on,” Maxwell protested. “Those
dogs have run down a good many crooks, first and
last. Follansbee will take any bet you want to
make, right now.”</p>

<p>“And he would lose,” was the confident answer.
“But come on; let’s see what’s going to
happen.”</p>

<p>The chase, with the dogs running upon a comparatively
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>fresh scent, led up through the pine
wood at the head of the gulch. Beyond the wood
was a bare, high-lying mesa table-land, with its
summer-baked soil dried out to almost rocky
hardness. A hundred yards from the gulch head
an indistinct road skirted the mesa edge, and here
the dogs began to run in circles.</p>

<p>Sprague was chuckling again, but Maxwell counselled
patience.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute,” he suggested. “The body-snatchers
probably had a team here. The dogs
will get the scent of the horses presently.”</p>

<p>“Think so?” queried the expert. Then he drew
his companion aside. “Do you know anything
about this road, Dick?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s the old wagon road from the Reservation
into the park.”</p>

<p>“Which way would you go toward Brewster?”</p>

<p>“That way,” said the superintendent, pointing.</p>

<p>“All right; let’s go a little way toward Brewster,
and perhaps I can show you why Mr. Follansbee
would lose his bet on his dogs.”</p>

<p>When they were well out of the dog-circling
area, the chemistry expert stooped and struck a
match. “See here,” he said; and Maxwell,
squatting beside him, saw the broad track of an
automobile tire. Sprague gurgled softly. “Do
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>you think the dogs will get the scent of that?” he
inquired.</p>

<p>Maxwell stood up and shoved his hands into his
pockets.</p>

<p>“Calvin, the way you hop across and light upon
the one only sure thing, comes mighty near being
uncanny, at times. How the devil did you find
out that those fellows came in an auto?”</p>

<p>“If I should tell you that it was pure reasoning,
you’d doubt it. But never mind the whys and
wherefores just now; they can come later. Tell
me how long we’re going to stay here losing time
on Follansbee and his dogs.”</p>

<p>“Not a minute longer than you care to stay.
What do you want to do?”</p>

<p>“I want to see that crippled express messenger
who was put off the train at Corona. Also, I’d
like to have a look at the dead man’s coffin.”</p>

<p>“You shall do both. If you’re taking the case,
you are very pointedly the only doctor there is in
it,” Maxwell asserted. Then he called to the
sheriff: “O Harding!” and when the county
officer came up: “I’m going to take the train and
run on to Corona after Galt. We’ll stop here for
your orders when we come back.”</p>

<p>During the short run around the hills to the
small mining-town station, Sprague sat quietly in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>his chair, puffing steadily at his cigar, and saying
nothing. When Maxwell announced their arrival
he got up and followed the superintendent
into the Corona office.</p>

<p>Galt, the express messenger, was lying on the
night operator’s cot in the telegraph office. Some
physician passenger on the held-up train had
dressed his wounds, and he had fully recovered
consciousness. His story was a mere amplification
of the wire report which had gone to Brewster.
He had marked, and wondered at, the unscheduled
stop on the gulch curve, but before he could open
his door to look out, the postal- and express-cars
had been pulled on ahead, his end door had been
battered in, and he had found himself trying to
fight back a couple of masked men who were forcing
an entrance. Then somebody hit him on the
head and that was the end of it, so far as he was
concerned.</p>

<p>Following this, the Corona night operator was
put upon the question rack. He knew only what
the trainmen had told him. No; there was nothing
missing out of the express-car save the dead
man’s body. While the train was waiting, he, the
operator, and the conductor had made a careful
check of the contents of the car from Galt’s waybills,
and, with the single exception noted, everything
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>was undisturbed. No, there was no panic;
the scare was pretty well quieted down by the time
the train reached Corona. Of course, a good many
of the passengers had got out at the station
stop, and everybody was curious to see the coffin.</p>

<p>“You took the coffin off?” Maxwell questioned.</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s in the freight-room.”</p>

<p>Sprague had taken no part in the examination
of the man, and had listened only cursorily to
Galt’s story. But now he became as curious as
any of the morbid passengers had been. Allen,
the operator, lighted a lantern and led the way to
the freight-room. The coffin was lying upon a
baggage-truck. It was encased in an ordinary
shipping-box, half of the cover of which had been
torn off. The lid of the coffin had been broken,
split into three pieces; and one of the pieces was
missing. It was a rather expensive affair, wooden
and not metallic, of the kind known as a “casket,”
silk-lined, and with a sliding glass face-plate. The
glass had been broken, and the fragments were
lying inside on the small silken pillow.</p>

<p>Sprague bent to examine the silent witness of
the mysterious robbery and the operator offered
his lantern. But the Government man took a
small electric flash-light from his pocket and made
it serve a better purpose. Only once, while he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>was flashing the tiny beam of the electric into
the coffin’s interior, did he speak, and then it was
to say to Maxwell: “I thought you said this was
a metallic coffin.”</p>

<p>“That was the inference, when you spoke of the
weight and the number of men required to handle
it. Of course, I didn’t know anything definite
about it.”</p>

<p>Once more Sprague peered into the silk-lined
interior, stooping to send the light ray to the foot
of the casket, which was still hidden under the undestroyed
half of the outer case. Then, snapping
the switch of the flash-light and carefully replacing
the broken box cover, he nodded briskly to Maxwell.</p>

<p>“That’s all, for the present. If I were you, I’d
have this coffin nailed up in its box, just as it is,
without disturbing anything. You can manage
that, can’t you, young man?” turning short upon
the operator.</p>

<p>Allen said he could and proceeded to do it; after
which, under Sprague’s direction, the case was
trundled out to the platform, and the three of
them, with Maxwell’s private-car porter to help,
loaded the coffin upon the front platform of Maxwell’s
car.</p>

<p>“We’ll take it back with us,” said the Government
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>man, with a sober twinkle in his eyes. “It’s
a passably good coffin, you know, and with a little
repairing it will do to use again&mdash;say, when we
have found the man it belongs to.”</p>

<p>While the night operator, the porter, and
the two enginemen were carrying the wounded
express messenger to the private car and making
him comfortable in Maxwell’s own state-room,
the superintendent’s curiosity got the better of
him.</p>

<p>“You’re not saying much, Calvin,” he offered.
“Have you found any clew to the mystery?”</p>

<p>“Clews?&mdash;yes; I’ve found plenty of them.
They’re slightly tangled as yet, but we’ll get hold
of the proper thread in a little while. When do
we start back?”</p>

<p>“Any time, if you’ve seen all you want to. I’ll
have Allen get orders for us right now, if you say
so.”</p>

<p>The big-bodied Government man stood aside
while the Corona operator called the despatcher
and obtained the order for the return of the two-car
special to Brewster. But after the bit of routine
was finished he made another suggestion.</p>

<p>“I’d like to know, in so many words, exactly
what was taken from the passengers on the train,
Dick,” he said. “Can’t you have this young man
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>catch the train somewhere and instruct the conductor
to find out for us?”</p>

<p>Maxwell nodded and gave Allen the necessary
directions. “Tell McCarty to wire his answer
direct to me at Brewster,” he added; and then,
as the train was ready, the start was made for the
return.</p>

<p>At the curve in Cromarty Gulch they found only
Tarbell awaiting them. When the ex-cowboy had
climbed aboard and the homeward run was resumed,
Tarbell made his report. Harding and
his posse were following the automobile tracks on
foot. It was the sheriff’s theory that, sooner or
later, the men in the machine would have to stop
somewhere, whereupon the dogs would once more
be able to take up the trail. Harding was convinced
now that he was trailing the Weber gang,
and he believed that the start toward Brewster
was only a blind.</p>

<p>Sprague smiled again at the mention of the
dogs.</p>

<p>“How far is it to Brewster?” he asked.</p>

<p>“About thirty miles, by the wagon road,”
Maxwell guessed.</p>

<p>“Good; we’re safely rid of Mr. Harding and his
people, and of Follansbee and his dogs, for some
little time, I take it. Now we are free to do a little
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>business on our own account. I want to know
everything you can tell me about this man Murtrie;
what he looked like, what he did, and all the
rest.”</p>

<p>“It’s a sort of thankless job to backcap a dead
man,” Maxwell demurred. “Just the same,
Murtrie always looked to me like a hired assassin&mdash;the
kind you see on the vaudeville stage, you
know. He was a big, beefy fellow, with a puffy
face and a bad eye.”</p>

<p>“Light or dark?”</p>

<p>“Dark; black eyes and a heavy, drooping mustache.
To tell the truth, he looked as little like
an expert mining engineer as anything you can
imagine. Wouldn’t you say so, Tarbell?”</p>

<p>The sober-faced young man who had made his
record running down cattle thieves in Montana
nodded gravely.</p>

<p>“What time he put in up at the Molly Baldwin
wouldn’t count for much,” was Tarbell’s comment.
“Mighty near any hour o’ the day or night
you could find him tryin’ out his ‘system’ at Bart
Holladay’s faro game; leastways, when he wasn’t
hangin’ round the railroad depot.”</p>

<p>“Yet you say, Maxwell, that he was sent out
here by the New York mineowners to keep cases
on the gold output?” questioned Sprague.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span></p>
<p>“Why, yes; that is what everybody said.”</p>

<p>“It’s what he said himself,” Tarbell put in.</p>

<p>“But you didn’t believe it?” queried Sprague,
turning upon the ex-cowboy.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know just what to believe,” was the
frank admission. “He was mighty thick with
Calthrop and Higgins, the two fellows that are
operatin’ the Molly Baldwin under the lease; but,
as I say, he didn’t stay there none to speak of.
And as for his bein’ a minin’ sharp&mdash;I don’t know
about that, but I do know that he was a brass-pounder.”</p>

<p>“A telegraph operator, you mean?” said
Sprague quickly. “How do you happen to know
that, Archer?”</p>

<p>“’Cause I caught him more than once ‘listenin’
in’ at the commercial office downstairs in the
depot.”</p>

<p>“How could you tell?” demanded the chemist
shrewdly.</p>

<p>“If you was an operator yourself, you’d know,
Mr. Sprague. You can take my word for it, all
right.”</p>

<p>The man whose recreative hobby was the application
of scientific principles to the detection of
crime, smoked in reflective silence for a minute or
two. Finally he said: “You are a much better
spotter than you think you are, Archer. It is a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>pity that this man Murtrie is dead. If he wasn’t,
I’d like to have you shadow him a bit more for us.
Where did you say he kept himself chiefly&mdash;in
Brewster, I mean?”</p>

<p>“At Bart Holladay’s road-house, on the Little
Butte pike. It’s a tough joint, with faro and
roulette runnin’ continuous in the back rooms,
and half a dozen poker games workin’ overtime
upstairs.”</p>

<p>“I see,” said Sprague thoughtfully; “or rather,
I’d like to see. Maybe, before I go home, you’ll
take a little time off some evening, Archer, and
drive me out to this road-house. It’s a free-for-all,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p>Tarbell grinned. “All you got to do is to give
the barkeep’ the high sign and go in and blow
yourself. Anybody’s money’s as good as anybody
else’s, to Bart.”</p>

<p>“All right; we’ll put that down as one of our
small recreations, after this dead-man muddle is
straightened out for Mr. Maxwell. Is this Brewster
we’re coming to?”</p>

<p>It was; and when the train shrilled to a stand
at the station the company ambulance was waiting
to take the wounded express messenger out to
the hospital. Also, there was a young man from
<i>The Tribune</i> office, who was anxious to get the
latest story of the sensational hold-up of the “Flying
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>Plainsman.” Tarbell was detailed to give the
reporter the facts in the case, so far as they had
developed, and Maxwell and his guest climbed the
stair to the despatcher’s room in the second story.
Connolly was rattling his key in the sending of a
train-order when they entered, but he “broke”
long enough to hand the superintendent a freshly
written telegram.</p>

<p>It was from McCarty, the “Plainsman” conductor,
and it was dated from Angels.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="no-indent">“To <span class="smcap">R. Maxwell</span>, G. S.,</p>

<p>“Brewster:</p>

<p>“Can’t find that anybody lost anything. Hold-up
in Pullmans was probably meant to keep passengers
bluffed while the others went through
express-car.</p>

<p class="no-indent right2">“<span class="smcap">McCarty.</span>”</p></div>

<p>Sprague nodded slowly when the telegram was
handed him. “That is what I suspected; in fact,
I was morally certain of it, but I thought it would
do no harm to make sure.” Then he turned to
the chubby despatcher who had finished sending
his train-order. “Mr. Connolly, has any one been
here to ask questions about this hold-up&mdash;since
we left, I mean?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span></p>
<p>Connolly looked his astonishment and nodded
an affirmative.</p>

<p>“Two men from out of town, weren’t they?”
Sprague suggested.</p>

<p>Again the despatcher nodded, and it was only
his respect for the big man that kept him from
asking how the incident could possibly be known
to one who had been thirty miles away at the moment
of its happening.</p>

<p>“Go on and tell us about it,” Sprague directed;
and at this Connolly found his tongue.</p>

<p>“It was them two fellows that are operating
the Molly Baldwin mine, Calthrop and Higgins.
They’d heard of the hold-up through the operator
at Little Butte, they said, and they drove down in
their auto. They seemed to be a whole lot stirred
up about the taking of Murtrie’s body; said they
felt responsible to his friends in the East. They
wanted to know particularly what we were doing
about it, and if there was any chance of our catching
up with the body-snatchers.”</p>

<p>Sprague waved his cigar in token of his complete
satisfaction. Then he went abruptly to something
else.</p>

<p>“Mr. Connolly, where can you catch that eastbound
train again for us by wire?”</p>

<p>Connolly glanced at his train-sheet.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span></p>
<p>“She’s due at Arroyo in eight minutes. It
ain’t a stop, but I can have the operator flag her
down.”</p>

<p>“Good. Do it, and send this message to McCarty,
conductor. Are you ready?” And when
the despatcher, quickly calling the station in question,
signalled his readiness, Sprague went on,
dictating slowly: “‘Hold your train and have
Calmaine, chief clerk, come to the wire.’ Sign
Mr. Maxwell’s name&mdash;that’s all right, isn’t it,
Maxwell?”</p>

<p>“Anything you say is all right,” was the quick
response.</p>

<p>“It won’t ball things up&mdash;holding your train a
few minutes at Arroyo?”</p>

<p>“Connolly will see to that. It’s off time now
and running on orders, anyway.”</p>

<p>“Then we can sit down quietly and wait to hear
from the exceedingly capable-looking young man
who has the honor to be your chief clerk,” said the
Government man, and he calmly planted himself
in the nearest chair.</p>

<p>“Calmaine will probably be abed and asleep in
the Pullman,” Maxwell suggested. “I suppose
your call is important enough to warrant his getting
up and dressing?”</p>

<p>“It is&mdash;fully important enough; as I think you
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>will be ready to admit when we hear from
Arroyo.” Then he extended a handful of cigars.
“Have a fresh smoke; oh, you needn’t look cross-eyed
at them; they’re your own, you know. I
swiped them out of your private box in the car
when you weren’t looking.”</p>

<p>Maxwell took a cigar half-absently. His mind
was dwelling upon the mystery surrounding the
unexplainable hold-up, with the surface current
of thought directed toward Connolly’s sounder,
through which would presently come the expected
message from Arroyo.</p>

<p>It was while he was holding the lighted match
to the cigar that the sounder began to click. He
translated for Sprague: “Train here. McCarty
gone to wake Mr. Calmaine.” After that there
was a trying wait of perhaps five minutes. Then
the sounder began to chatter rapidly, and Maxwell
bounded from his chair.</p>

<p>“Good God!” he ejaculated, “he says Calmaine
isn’t on the train!”</p>

<p>“Ah!” breathed the big-bodied expert, rising
and stretching his huge arms over his head.
“Again we get the expected precipitation in the
test-tube. Mr. Connolly, suppose you ask McCarty
if Mr. Calmaine has been on the train at all.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span></p>
<p>Connolly hastily tapped out the question, and
a moment afterward vocalized the answer.</p>

<p>“He was on the train when it left Brewster.
Nobody seems to remember seeing him after that.”</p>

<p>Sprague turned to his host.</p>

<p>“I think we can let Mr. McCarty go in peace
now, with a promise that we sha’n’t bother him
again to-night. Tarbell is the man we shall need
from this on. Where has he gone?”</p>

<p>Tarbell was at that moment opening the corridor
door, having but now got rid of the newspaper
reporter. Sprague began on him briskly.</p>

<p>“Archer, the muddle is cleared up, and I’m
minded to take that bit of recreation we spoke of
a while back&mdash;at this Mr. Bart Holladay’s show
place, you know. How far did you say it is?”</p>

<p>The ex-cowboy looked dazed, but he made shift
to answer the direct question.</p>

<p>“About two mile, I reckon.”</p>

<p>“Outside of the city limits?”</p>

<p>“Yep.”</p>

<p>“Then we can’t take a policeman along for protection&mdash;I’m
a tenderfoot, and all tenderfoots are
nervous, you know. That’s too bad. And Mr.
Harding isn’t here to let us have the backing of the
county officers. Dear, dear! Are they <i>very</i> bad
men out there, Archer?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span></p>
<p>Tarbell grinned sheepishly, feeling sure that the
big man was in some way making game of him.</p>

<p>“They’d eat you alive if they thought you was
an officer headin’ a raid on ’em. Otherwise, I
reckon they wouldn’t bite you none.”</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose we shall have to risk it&mdash;without
the policeman,” said the expert with a good-natured
laugh. “Perhaps we can persuade them
that we are just ‘lookers,’” he suggested. And
then: “I suppose you have your artillery with
you?”</p>

<p>Tarbell nodded. “A couple o’ forty-fives. I’d
hardly go huntin’ train-robbers without ’em.”</p>

<p>“Of course not. Suppose you divide up with
Mr. Maxwell here, and then go and find us an
auto; just the bare car; we’ll manage to drive it
ourselves. And, Archer, get a good big one, with
easy springs. If there is any one thing I dislike
more than another it is to be jammed up in a little,
hard-riding car. I need plenty of room. I guess
I grew too much when I was a boy.”</p>

<p>The young man with the sober face went away,
still more or less dazed; and Maxwell dropped the
weapon that Tarbell had given him into the outside
pocket of his top-coat.</p>

<p>“I am completely and totally in the dark as
yet, Calvin,” he ventured. “Did you mean what
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>you said when you told Tarbell just now that the
muddle was cleared up?”</p>

<p>“I did, indeed. And it is as pretty a piece of
off-hand plotting as I have ever come across, Dick.
Don’t you see daylight by this time?”</p>

<p>“Not a ray. It may be just natural stupidity;
or it may be only a bad case of rattle. I blew up
and went to pieces when that wire came about Calmaine.
Why, good heavens, think of it, Calvin!
If the boy’s gone, those proxies are gone, too!”</p>

<p>“Quite so. And you are wondering why a good,
steady, well-balanced young fellow like your chief
clerk should get himself lost in the shuffle when his
mission was so vitally important. What do you
suppose has become of him?”</p>

<p>“I can’t begin to guess. That is what is driving
me mad. Of course, the supposition is that he got
mixed up in this body-snatching business in some
way. But why should he? Why the devil should
he, Calvin, when he had every possible reason for
dodging and keeping out of it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” rejoined the big man, with a
head-wagging of doubt, real or simulated. “One
of the most difficult things to prefigure&mdash;you might
say the only one which refuses to come under the
test-tube formulas&mdash;is just what a given man will
do under certain suddenly sprung conditions. It
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>is the only problematical element which ever enters
into these puzzle-solvings of mine. I haven’t
the pleasure of an intimate acquaintance with your
chief clerk, but from the little I’ve seen of him I
should say unhesitatingly that he is a young man
for an emergency, quick to think, and fully as quick
to act. I’m banking on that impression and hoping
that he hasn’t disappointed me.”</p>

<p>“Then you know what has become of him?”</p>

<p>Sprague smiled impassively. “I shouldn’t be
able to convince you that it is knowledge,” he admitted.
“You’d call it nothing more than a wild
guess. Isn’t that our auto that I hear?”</p>

<p>Maxwell stepped to a window and looked down
upon the plaza.</p>

<p>“It’s somebody’s auto,” he said. “There are
two men in it.” And a moment later&mdash;“They are
coming up here.”</p>

<p>The demonstrator of scientific principles hooked
his elbows on the counter railing and laughed
gently. “Our two nervous friends from the Molly
Baldwin,” he predicted. “They are still worrying
about the loss of their corpse.” And even as he
spoke the two young lessees of the mine came
tramping in, their faces sufficiently advertising
their anxiety.</p>

<p>Maxwell nodded to the file-leader of the pair.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span></p>
<p>“Hello, Calthrop,” he said. “What do you
know?”</p>

<p>“Nothing more than we did. We heard that
you’d got back from Cromarty and thought maybe
you could tell us something.”</p>

<p>“Not anything definite,” was the superintendent’s
brief rejoinder. “You know the facts; Murtrie’s
body was taken out of its coffin and carried
off. There were auto tracks on the mesa at the
head of Cromarty Gulch, and Harding and his
posse are following them. That’s all.”</p>

<p>“Wh-where is that coffin, now?” It was the
younger of the two who wanted to know.</p>

<p>Without looking around, Maxwell felt that
Sprague’s eyes were signalling him, but he could
hardly determine why he was moved to tell only
part of the truth.</p>

<p>“It was taken off at Corona.”</p>

<p>The one who answered to the name of Calthrop
swore morosely. “It’s the Scott Weber gang, ain’t
it, Mr. Maxwell?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I think so; and Harding thinks so. But why
they should steal only a dead body is beyond me&mdash;or
any of us.”</p>

<p>The two young men exchanged a whispered word
or two and went out, with the anxiety in their
faces thickly shot with fresh perplexity. At the
door Higgins turned for another asking.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span></p>
<p>“If we pay the freight on it, can we have that
coffin back, Mr. Maxwell? We bought it and paid
for it.”</p>

<p>This time Maxwell caught Sprague’s eye and
read the warning in it. “We’ll see about that
later,” he said.</p>

<p>When the door slammed at the outgoing of the
pair, Sprague was laughing again.</p>

<p>“After those two young fellows have turned a
few more sharp corners in the rather crooked course
they’re steering, they’ll learn to take their medicine
without making faces over it,” he remarked.
“Any signs of Archer yet?”</p>

<p>Maxwell turned back to the window.</p>

<p>“Yes; he’s coming. He’s pulling up on the
other side of the plaza&mdash;doesn’t want to run afoul
of these mining friends of ours, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Archer has a head on him, all right, and I like
him. You want to swing onto that young fellow,
Dick. He’ll make a good man for you some day.
Let’s go down and join him.”</p>

<p>Tarbell waited when he saw the boss and his
guest coming across the plaza, and when his two
fares were stowed in the roomy tonneau of the big
car he let the clutch in for the short run to the
western suburb. The night was clear and starlit,
but there was no moon. Since the hour was
well past midnight, the streets were practically
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>deserted. Beyond the last of the street-crossing
arc-lamps the western road led away through a
forest of dwarf pine, a broad white pathway winding
among the trees and roughly paralleling the
railroad.</p>

<p>At one of the shorter turns in the pike they came
upon the brilliantly lighted road-house. In appearance
it was a modern roadside tavern, one of
the many which owe their sudden recrudescence to
the automobile. It was withdrawn a little from
the highway, and was surrounded by ample stables
and shelter sheds opening upon a great square
yard with wide carriage gates. Tarbell backed
the auto to a stand among a number of others in
the yard, and a man with a lantern came, ostensibly
to offer help, but probably to make sure that
the new-comers were harmless.</p>

<p>“It’s all right, Jerry,” said Tarbell, hopping out.
“Mr. Maxwell and a friend o’ his from the East.
Games goin’?”</p>

<p>The man nodded and held his lantern so that
Maxwell and his guest could see to get out of the
tonneau. Then he turned away and left them.</p>

<p>Tarbell led the way to the porch entrance and
on the step explained the sight-seeing process to
the one who was supposed to be inexperienced.</p>

<p>“It’s an open game, as I let on to you,” he told
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>Sprague. “You go into the bar and buy. After
that you do as you please.”</p>

<p>Sprague paused for a single question.</p>

<p>“What do we find?” he asked.</p>

<p>“A lot of young bloods from town, mostly,” was
Tarbell’s reply. “Holladay’s got sense enough to
keep his own gang in the quiet and take his rake-off
as it comes&mdash;from the bank and the tables and
the roulette wheels.”</p>

<p>Sprague made the single question a little more
comprehensive.</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean the people, so much as the place;
if we should want to get out in a hurry&mdash;how about
that?”</p>

<p>Tarbell indicated a hall door at the side of the
main entrance, adding the information, however,
that it was usually kept locked.</p>

<p>“Good. After we get to going, inside, you make
it your job to unlock that door, Archer, and to put
the key in your pocket. Now I’m ready, and I
want to see it all.” And they went in.</p>

<p>The bar-room proved to be typical of its kind:
plainly furnished, with a wide country-house fireplace
and a sanded floor. As the night was close
and warm, the card-tables were ranged beneath
the open windows; only two or three of them were
occupied, and the bar itself was empty. Maxwell
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>and his guest sat down at one of the unoccupied
tables, and Tarbell ordered for the three. When
the liquor was served, he said: “You don’t need
to sop it up inside of you if you don’t want to;
it’s none too good.”</p>

<p>With this for a caution the two who were warned
carefully spilled their portions on the sanded door,
and Sprague ordered cigars, skilfully juggling them
when they came and substituting three of his own&mdash;or
rather of Maxwell’s. Then he made a sign to
Tarbell and they began to make a slow tour of the
open game-rooms.</p>

<p>The first-floor rooms, where a pair of roulette
wheels were spinning and a faro game was running,
were well filled. Brewster had lately passed an
anti-gambling ordinance, and the vice had been
temporarily driven beyond the corporation limits.
Maxwell saw a few men whom he knew, and many
who were well known to the Brewster police. Under
the archway dividing the red-and-black wheels
from the faro table Sprague whispered in his ear.</p>

<p>“I’m looking for a man whose New York name
is ‘Tapper’ Givens,” he said. “He has a red face,
black hair and eyes, and weighs about one hundred
and eighty pounds. He may, or may not, be wearing
a heavy black mustache, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Maxwell looked up with a puzzled frown. “Say,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>Calvin; you’re describing the dead man,” he
broke in.</p>

<p>“Am I? Never mind if I am. If you should
happen to see any one filling the requirements, just
point him out to me. I might overlook him in
such a crowd as this, you know.” And then to
Tarbell, who had just found them again: “Got
that key, Archer?”</p>

<p>The ex-cowboy showed the hall door key cautiously
in his palm and returned it to his pocket.
Sprague smiled and whispered again.</p>

<p>“How about the rooms upstairs? Are they
open to inspection, too?”</p>

<p>Tarbell shook his head. “No; private poker
games, most of ’em.”</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, I think we shall have to have a
look-in,” said the big man quietly. “Can’t you
arrange it?”</p>

<p>“Not without riskin’ a scrap.”</p>

<p>“We don’t want to start anything, but we’ve
just naturally got to have that look-in, Archer,”
persisted the guest.</p>

<p>The grave-faced young Tennessean thrust out
his jaw. “What you say goes as she lays,” he
returned, and thereupon he showed them the way
upstairs.</p>

<p>At the stair-head there was a guard, a bullet-headed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>ring-fighter posing as a waiter, with a
square patch of an apron and a napkin thrown over
one arm.</p>

<p>“Mr. Maxwell’s lookin’ for one of his men,”
said Tarbell, realizing that some sort of an excuse
must be offered; and the ring-fighter, who knew
the railroad superintendent by sight, nodded and
said:</p>

<p>“That’s aw right; who is ut?”</p>

<p>“Harvey Calmaine,” said Tarbell, giving the
first name that came into his head.</p>

<p>To the astoundment of at least two of the three,
the bullet-headed guard stood aside and pointed
to a door at the farther end of the upper hall.</p>

<p>“He’s in there,” he grunted. “Somebody’s
been givin’ him th’ knock-out drops, an’ they’re
workin’ over him.” Then he spun around and put
a ham-like hand flat against Maxwell’s chest.
“Ye’ll gimme yer wor-rd, Misther Maxwell, that
ye haven’t got the sheriff’s posse at yer back?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Maxwell, and he managed to say it
with a degree of coolness which he was very far
from feeling. “We’re all here; all there are of us.”</p>

<p>“Aw right; gwan in. But there’ll be no
scrappin’, mind ye. If there does be anny, I’ll be
takin’ a hand, meself.”</p>

<p>Sprague took the lead in the silent march to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>indicated door, his big bulk looming colossal in
the narrow, low-studded hallway. Reaching the
door, he turned the knob noiselessly. “Locked,”
he muttered, and then he drew back and put his
shoulder to it.</p>

<p>The lock gave way with a report like a muffled
pistol shot and the door flew open. The room was
lighted by a single incandescent bulb swinging on
its cord from the ceiling. On a cot which had
been dragged out from its place beside the wall lay
the chief clerk, bare-footed, gagged, and securely
bound with many wrappings of cotton clothes-line.
Standing over him, one of them with the lighted
match he had been holding to the bare foot-soles
still blazing, were two others; a red-headed,
yellow-faced man with one eye missing, and a thick-shouldered
athlete aptly answering to Sprague’s
description whispered to the superintendent in
the room below.</p>

<p>Maxwell sprang forward with an oath when he
recognized the man with the burning match.
“<i>Murtrie!</i>” he exploded; and the torturer with
the black eyes and puffy face dropped the match-end
and grabbed for his weapon. He was a fraction
of a second too slow. Tarbell had covered
him with a movement which was too quick for
the eye to follow and was reaching backward for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>the other gun&mdash;which Maxwell gave him&mdash;while
Sprague closed the door and set his back against it.</p>

<p>“The jig is up&mdash;definitely up, Givens,” said the
Government man pleasantly. And then to Tarbell:
“Herd those two into a corner, Archer, while
we take some of these impediments off of Mr.
Calmaine.”</p>

<p>When the chief clerk was freed he tried to sit up;
tried and would have fallen if Maxwell had not
caught him. “They’ve burked me,” he mumbled;
“but&mdash;they didn’t make me tell, and they didn’t
get&mdash;the papers.”</p>

<p>“Take it easy,” said Maxwell soothingly;
“You’ll be all right in a minute or so.” Then, in
a fresh access of rage: “They’ll pay for this, Harvey,
if it takes every dollar I’ve got in the world!”</p>

<p>Calmaine tried sitting up again, found that he
could compass it, and reached feebly for his shoes
and socks.</p>

<p>“The&mdash;the proxies are safe&mdash;if it doesn’t rain,”
he quavered, his mind still running on the precious
papers of which he had been the bearer. “Get&mdash;get
me out of this and into an auto and I’ll find
them for you. We might&mdash;might catch Number
Six, if we hurry.”</p>

<p>Tarbell, with Sprague’s help, had deftly handcuffed
the two men whom he had backed into a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>corner. It was the one-eyed man who first found
speech in an outpouring of profanity venomous
and horrible. “You ain’t got us out o’ here yet,”
he spat, trailing the defiance out in more of the
cursings.</p>

<p>“But we’re going to get you out if we have to
throw you through the window,” said Sprague
quietly. Then to Maxwell: “Help the boy with
his shoes, Dick. We’re due to have a jail delivery
here, any minute.”</p>

<p>It took some little time to get the maltreated
chief clerk shod and afoot, and even then he was
well-nigh crippled. But he was game to the last.
“They took my gun away from me,” he complained.
“If I only had something to fight with&mdash;Archer,
give me that black devil’s pistol.”</p>

<p>Sprague’s warning had not been baseless. The
stair-head guard had doubtless seen Sprague
shoulder the locked door open, and had sprung
a still alarm. There was a hurrying of many feet
in the hall, marking the gathering of the gambling-house
fighting force. While Calmaine was asking
for a weapon, the crowd in the hall began to batter
at the door, against which Sprague had once
more put his huge bulk, and were calling to
Murtrie to open to them.</p>

<p>Sprague gave his directions snappily, as if he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>were signalling his foot-ball squad. “Draw that
cot a little this way&mdash;that’s right. Now then,
Archer, stand here against the wall with your two
jail-birds, and when I give the word, rush ’em for
the yard by the stairway entrance. If they don’t
obey, plug ’em, and plug ’em quick. Maxwell, you
and the boy get over on this side. When you’re
ready, turn off that light. Quick! They’re going
to charge us!”</p>

<p>The simple programme was carried out precisely
and to the letter. When the rush came the room
was in darkness, and Sprague stepped lightly
aside. Thereupon a dozen charging men, finding
no resistance in the suddenly released door,
piled themselves in cursing confusion over the
barricading cot.</p>

<p>“Now!” shouted Sprague, and the dash for
liberty was made, with the big man in the lead
clearing the hall of its stragglers, brushing them
aside with his mighty weight or driving them before
him like chaff in the fury of his onset. At the
stair-head there were more coming up from below:
Sprague caught the bullet-headed ring-fighter
around the waist, and using him as a missile,
cleared the stairway at a single throw. “Come
on!” he yelled to those who were behind; and a
moment later the unlocked door at the stair-foot
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>gave them egress to the open air and to the yard
where the automobiles were parked.</p>

<p>Quite naturally, the din of the battle had precipitated
a panic in the unlicensed road-house, and
the building was disgorging, through doors and
windows, and even over the roofs of the shelter
sheds. Tarbell drove his two prisoners into the
tonneau of the hired car, while Maxwell promptly
cranked the motor and Sprague lifted Calmaine
bodily to the front seat. Ten seconds beyond this,
while the panic was still at its height, the hired car,
leading all others in the townward rush, was leaving
a dense dust trail to befog its followers, and
the capture and rescue were facts accomplished.</p>

<p>With Tarbell at the steering-wheel, the car sped
silently through the western suburb and came into
the deserted, echoing streets of the city. Without
asking any questions, the ex-cowboy drove straight
to the county jail and pulled up at the curb in front
of the grim building, with its heavily grilled windows
showing their steel barrings in the street
light. Sprague passed the two prisoners out to
him, jerking even the bigger of the two clear of the
auto step as if he had been a feather-weight. But
when Tarbell would have marched the pair across
the sidewalk, Sprague called out.</p>

<p>“Just one question, Givens,” he said brusquely.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>“You know what you’re in for; you know that you
are still wanted in Cleveland on that charge of
counterfeiting. But if you’ll answer one question
straight, we’ll forget the Ohio indictment for the
present. What did you do with the swag that you
lifted a few hours ago?”</p>

<p>For five full seconds the black-haired man kept
silence. Then he spoke as the spirit moved him.</p>

<p>“It’s where you won’t get it&mdash;you n’r them
make-believe crooks up at the Molly Baldwin!”
he rasped.</p>

<p>“Oho!” Sprague laughed. “So you planned it
to give your side partners in this little game the
double-cross, did you? It’s like you. Take them
away, Archer.”</p>

<p>“And&mdash;and hurry back!” whispered Calmaine
hoarsely. “We’ve simply <i>got</i> to catch Number
Six, I tell you!”</p>

<p>Thus urged, Tarbell expedited matters with the
night jailer and came running back to take his
place behind the steering-wheel.</p>

<p>“Where now?” he asked, dropping the clutch
in; and it was Calmaine who gave the direction.</p>

<p>“The Reservation Road east; it’s the one we
came in over.”</p>

<p>Tarbell easily broke all the speed records, to
say nothing of speed limits, in the race to the eastward
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>over the dry mesa country. Twenty-odd
miles from town they met the sheriff’s party, and
there was a momentary halt for explanations.
“Camp down right where you are, and we’ll go
back pretty soon and send a bunch of autos out
after you,” was Maxwell’s word of encouragement;
and then the big car sped on its way
toward Cromarty Gulch.</p>

<p>Calmaine seemed to have preserved his sense
of locality marvellously. A few hundred yards
short of the spot at the gulch head where Follansbee’s
dogs had begun their aimless circlings, he
told Tarbell to pull up.</p>

<p>“They are right along here, somewhere,” he
said, getting out to hobble painfully ahead of the
others when Tarbell took off a side-lamp to serve
for a lantern. “They had me blindfolded, at first,
and I didn’t know what they were trying to do
with me. When they chucked me into the auto,
I tried to make a get-away. While they were
knocking me silly again, I managed to get the papers
out of my pocket and fire them into the sagebrush.
It was right along here, somewhere.”</p>

<p>It was Sprague who discovered the thick packet
upon which so much depended. It was lying cleverly
chance-hidden under a clump of the greasewood
bushes. “Found!” he announced. And then
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>he gave the young chief clerk his due meed of commendation.
“You’re a young man to bet on, Mr.
Calmaine. What we’ve been able to do, thus far,
wouldn’t amount to much if you hadn’t kept your
head.” Then he turned quickly to the superintendent.
“How do we stand for time, now, Maxwell?”</p>

<p>Maxwell held his watch to the light and shook
his head dejectedly.</p>

<p>“Number Six, the Fast Mail, is due at Corona
in five minutes. We can never make it in this
world!”</p>

<p>“You bet we can!” shouted Tarbell. “Help
Mr. Calmaine, and pile into the car&mdash;quick!”</p>

<p>The short race to the near-by mining-camp was
a sheer breakneck dash, but Tarbell made good.
When the four of them leaped from the car and
stormed into Allen’s office, the Fast Mail had already
whistled for the “clear” signal, and the
operator was reaching for the cord of his semaphore
to give the “go-by” wigwag. They yelled
at him as one man; and a few seconds later the
fast train slid to a shrieking stop at the station.</p>

<p>Maxwell would have sent Tarbell on to New
York with the precious proxies, but Calmaine
pleaded pathetically for his chance to finish that
which he had begun.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span></p>
<p>“I’ll be all right as soon as I can get into the
sleeper and get these infernal shoes off,” he protested.
“It’s my job, Mr. Maxwell; for pity’s
sake don’t make me a quitter!”</p>

<p>“Let him go,” said Sprague; “he’s earned his
chance to stay in the game&mdash;and this time he’ll
make a touch-down.” And so it was decided.</p>

<p>When the Fast Mail, with its lately added passenger,
had slid away among the hills to the eastward,
the three who remained at Corona climbed
into the hired auto and Tarbell drove another record
race to town, pausing only once, when they
reached the sheriff’s roadside camp, to take on
Harding and as many of his deputies as the car
would hold.</p>

<p>By Maxwell’s direction, Tarbell drove first to
the railroad head-quarters, where the superintendent
and his guest got out. At the office entrance
another dusty car was drawn up; and in the upper
corridor they found the two young men from the
Molly Baldwin mine, still seeking for information.
Sprague disposed of them, and he did it with
business-like brevity.</p>

<p>“Your dead man has been found,” he told them
crisply. “He is at present in the county jail, with
one of his accomplices; and when he is given the
third degree, he will probably tell all he knows.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>It’s a weakness he has&mdash;not to be able to hold out
against a bit of rough handling. If you two fellows
will make a clean breast of your part in the
swindle to the prosecuting attorney, and promise to
play fair with your lessors in future, it is likely that
you’ll be let off with a fine, and you’ll probably be
able to bag the remainder of the gang and to recover
your lost gold.”</p>

<p>The two young men heard, gasped, and backed
away. When they were gone, Maxwell unlocked
the door of his business office, snapped on the
lights, opened his desk, and pressed the electric
button which summoned Connolly, the night despatcher.</p>

<p>“I thought you’d like to know that we’ve caught
up with the dead man, Dan,” he said, when the
fat despatcher came in; and then he briefed the
story of the chase, winding up with a peremptory
order to be sent to the division despatcher at the
Copah end of the line not to let the eastbound
connection get away from the Fast Mail at the
main line junction.</p>

<p>When Connolly had gone back to his key, Maxwell
wheeled upon his guest.</p>

<p>“It’s late, Calvin, and by all the laws of hospitality
I ought to take you home and put you to
bed. But I’ll be hanged if you shall close an eye
until you’ve told me how you did all this!”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span></p>
<p>The expert chemist ex-foot-ball coach planted
himself in the easiest of the office chairs and
chuckled joyously.</p>

<p>“Gets you, does it?” he said; and then: “I’m
not sure that I can explain it so that you will understand,
but I’ll try. In the first place, it is necessary
to go at these little problems with a perfectly
open mind&mdash;the laboratory mind, which is neither
prejudiced nor prepossessed nor in any way concerned
with anything but the bare facts. Reason,
and the proper emphasis to be placed upon each
fact as it comes to bat, are the two needful qualities
in any problem-solving&mdash;and about the only
two.”</p>

<p>“You are soaring around about a mile over my
head; but go on,” said Maxwell.</p>

<p>“All right; I’ll set out the facts in the order in
which they came to me. First, I see a dozen men
loading a coffin into an express-car. I note the extreme
weight, and wonder how a dead man, any
dead man who doesn’t have to have his coffin built
to order, can be so infernally heavy. Next, you
tell me about your proxy fact&mdash;which doesn’t have
any bearing at the moment&mdash;and then you tell me
about the dead man, and how his friends were
shipping him to Kentucky. Then comes the news
of the bizarre hold-up in Cromarty Gulch. Instantly
the reasoning mind, the laboratory mind,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>if you prefer, goes to work, with the two foreknown
facts&mdash;the heavy-dead-man fact, and the fact that
your chief clerk is on that train with his valuable
papers&mdash;clamoring each for its hearing. Don’t let
me bore you.”</p>

<p>“Heavens&mdash;you’re not boring me! What next?”</p>

<p>“Reason, the laboratory brand of it, tells me immediately
that your proxy fact has the emphasis.
You had told me that your Wall Street opponents
had been throwing stumbling-blocks in your way
in the obtaining of the proxies. Here, said I, is
the last desperate resort. Nevertheless, there were
complications. I was pretty sure that the hold-ups
had taken Calmaine and his papers; that this
was what the hold-up was for. But in order to
get track of them&mdash;and of Calmaine&mdash;other facts
must be added. We added them on the trip with
the special train; all we needed, and a few more
thrown in for good measure.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see it,” Maxwell objected.</p>

<p>“Don’t you? When we reached the scene of the
hold-up, I was already doubting the heavy-dead-man
theory; doubting it extremely. Also, my
reason told me that the robbers, carrying some
weight which was heavier than any dead person,
would not trust to a team which could be overtaken,
if need be, by pursuers on foot. Hence the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>automobile track that we found. Then we came
to the coffin, and half of the mystery vanished at
once. If you hadn’t been excited and&mdash;well, let
us say, prepossessed, you would have noticed that
there was no smell of disinfectants, that the coffin
pillow wasn’t dented with the print of a head,
that the broken glass was lying on the pillow, as it
wouldn’t have been if the man’s head had been
there when the plate was smashed, that&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Great Scott,” Maxwell broke in, in honest self-depreciation,
“what blind bats we are&mdash;most of us!”</p>

<p>“Oh, no; I was bringing the specially trained
mind to bear, you must remember; the scientifically
trained mind. You couldn’t afford to cultivate
it; it wouldn’t leave room for your business of
railroad managing. But I’ll cut it short. I saw
that there had been no corpse in the coffin, and
that there had been something else in it&mdash;something
heavy enough to leave its marks on the silk
lining, which was torn and soiled. Also, I saw,
away down in the foot end of the thing, an ingot-shaped
chunk of something that looked like a bar
of gold bullion; one piece of the heavy coffin load
that had been overlooked in the hurried emptying.
That’s why I advised you to bring the coffin back
on your train. There’s a ten-thousand-dollar gold
brick in it, right now!”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span></p>
<p>“Heavens and earth!” gasped the listener; but
Sprague went on rapidly.</p>

<p>“Just here is where your machine-made detective
would have missed the emphasis. But the scientist,
having once for good and sufficient reasons
placed his emphasis, never has occasion to change
it. The main thing yet was the stopping of your
messenger to Ford. I was convinced that the gold
robbery, in which, of course, not only the two
young lessees, but the man Murtrie as well, must
be implicated, was only a side-issue, intended
either to divert attention from the main thing, or as
a double-cross theft on the part of Murtrie. When
you and Tarbell described Murtrie for me on the
way back to town, I had it all, simply because I
happened to know the man. He is a counterfeiter,
whom I have twice run down for the Department
of Justice; but who, both times, contrived to break
jail and get away.”</p>

<p>“But how were you able to strike so sure and
hard at Holladay’s?”</p>

<p>“Just a bit more reasoning; as you’ll see presently.
After we had established the fact that Calmaine
wasn’t on the train&mdash;but argue it out for
yourself. They’d take him somewhere where he
could be kept safe and out of the way until the
criminals concerned were all securely out of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>country. And where would they take him if
not to the unlawful den out yonder on the pike
where Murtrie was best known, and from which,
no doubt, he secured his helpers for the hold-up
job?”</p>

<p>“But hold on,” Maxwell interrupted. “I
haven’t got it entirely clear yet. If Murtrie put
up this job with Calthrop and Higgins&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Sprague shook his head.</p>

<p>“You have no imagination, Dick. Murtrie
came here to do you up in the proxy business&mdash;as
the Wall Street crowd’s last resort. He got in
with Calthrop and Higgins and showed them how
to beat their game, meaning to put the double-cross
on them&mdash;as he did&mdash;when the time came.
He was merely killing two birds with one stone;
but your bird was the big one. I don’t know what
sort of a dodge he put up with Calthrop and Higgins,
but I can suppose that there is a trusty confederate
at the Kentucky end of the string who is
doubtless waiting now for a corpse that will never
come.”</p>

<p>“Of course!” said the unimaginative one disgustedly.
“Just the same, it’s all mighty miraculous
to me, Calvin&mdash;how you can reason out these
things hot off the bat, as you do. Why, Great
Jonah! I had all the opportunities you had, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>then some; and I didn’t see an inch ahead of
my nose at any stage of the game!”</p>

<p>The big man rose and yawned good-naturedly.</p>

<p>“It’s my hobby&mdash;not yours,” he laughed; and
then, as the telephone buzzer went off with a purring
noise under Maxwell’s desk: “That will be
Mrs. Maxwell, calling up to ask why in the world
you don’t come home. Tell her all right, and let’s
go. It will be the biggest miracle of all if you succeed
in getting me up in time for breakfast to-morrow&mdash;or
rather, I should say, to-day, since it’s
three o’clock, and worse, right now.”</p>

<p>Maxwell put the receiver to his ear and exchanged
a few words with some one at the other
end of the wire. When he closed his desk and
made ready to go, a little frown of reflective
puzzlement was gathering between his eyes.</p>

<p>“You know too much&mdash;too thundering much,
Calvin. As I said a while back, it’s uncanny. It
was Alice; and she said the very words you said
she would: ‘Why in the world don’t you come
home, Dick?’ If you weren’t so blooming big and
beefy and good-natured&mdash;but, pshaw! who ever
heard of a fat wizard? Come on; let’s go and
hunt a taxi. It’s too far to walk.”</p>

<span class="reduce">The Electrocution of Tunnel Number Three</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">A</span>T ten o’clock on the second Tuesday after the
return of the lately promoted chief night despatcher,
Dan Connolly, from his wedding trip, the
business of the Brewster wire office had settled
down, momentarily at least, into the comfortable
rut of routine. Everything was moving smoothly
on the double division, and between the leisurely
inscribing of the figured entries on the train-sheet,
the fat, jolly-looking night chief had a chance to
fill his corn-cob pipe and to swap a word of gossip
now and then with Johnson, the car-record operator
who, as “Wire-Devil” Bolton’s successor, was
clattering at his type-writer in the far corner of the
bare room.</p>

<p>It was after he had finished typing the long
“record” report from Red Butte that Johnson
twisted himself in his chair to say: “Who is that
fellow ‘Scientific Sprague’ that I’ve been hearing
so much about since I came on the job, Dan?”</p>

<p>The fat despatcher chuckled reminiscently and
sat back in his tilting chair.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span></p>
<p>“Mr. Sprague? He’s a whole team, and an
extra horse hitched on behind, Shorty; that’s
about what he is. Don’t you ever go around
advertising your freshness in the Timanyoni by
giving it out that you don’t know Mr. Calvin
Sprague.”</p>

<p>“I reckon I’ve already done done it, haven’t
I?” laughed the car-record man. “What if you
fix me so I won’t have to do it again?”</p>

<p>Connolly held a lighted match to the blackened
bowl of the corn-cob, and then put both match and
pipe aside to take the “train-passing” report of
the incoming westbound “Quick-step” as it was
clicked through the sounder from the first telegraph
station east of Brewster.</p>

<p>“Mr. Sprague is about the biggest man that ever
walked into this office, Shorty,” he averred, after
he had made the proper train-sheet entry for
the approaching train. “Big up and down, big
through the middle, big sideways, and biggest of
all in his think-tank. He can look you over
twice and tell you the exact size of the yellow spot
on your liver; and if that won’t do, he’ll look you
over again and tell you how all-fired near you came
to breaking your bond record one night up at that
little shack station you’ve been running in the
mining country.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span></p>

<p>The newly appointed car-record man bounded
out of his chair as if he had been shot.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I didn’t, Dan!” he protested, dry-lipped;
“so help me God, I didn’t!” And then, curiosity
getting the better of the sudden shock: “How in
Sam Hill did you know?”</p>

<p>Connolly grinned good-naturedly and made a
motion with the flat of his hand as if he would
reach across the room and push Johnson back into
his chair.</p>

<p>“Take it plumb easy, kid,” he laughed. “I was
only talking through my hat&mdash;just hitting out in
the dark to show you how Mr. Sprague could size
you up if he wanted to. But you asked who he is:
he’s a friend of Mr. Maxwell’s, and he lives in
Washington when he’s at home&mdash;does chemical
stunts in one of the Government offices. He’s
happened to soak in here a couple of times when
we were needing a bushel or two more brains than
we could make out to rustle up among ourselves,
and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The break came in an importunate chattering
of the west-line sounder on Connolly’s table, and
the despatcher righted his tilted chair with a
thump and fell upon his key. The car-record man
sat back with his hands locked at the nape of his
neck and looked on absently. Out of the din and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>clatter of the several sounders he could easily have
picked the story that was coming from the west
over Connolly’s wire, but the trained operator’s
habit of ignoring the irrelevant wire chatter was
upon him, and his first intimation of the nature of
the story came in the fading of the ruddy flush in
Connolly’s full-moon cheeks and the uncontrollable
trembling of the despatcher’s left and unbusied
hand.</p>

<p>Instantly the short-legged car-record operator
left his chair and crossed the room to hang over
Connolly’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“What’s the trouble, Dan?” he asked.</p>

<p>“It’s just a little more of the same,” breathed
the fat one vindictively. “I don’t know what in
the devil has got into the trainmen lately; this
dog-blasted railroad’s getting so it runs itself!
Here’s Seventeen overrunning her orders and trying
to make the west end of Tunnel Number Three
against the Fast Mail. Nophi says he argued with
’em, but they said they had plenty of time and
went on. By grabs! if I was Mr. Maxwell I’d
make a sizzlin’ red-hot example of some of these
crazy chance-takers!”</p>

<p>Johnson was running his eye down the columns
of figures in the time-table.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t worry till I had to,” he put in.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>“The Mail’s twenty minutes off her schedule,
and that gives Seventeen thirty minutes to make
the six miles from Nophi to the tunnel and the
mile and a quarter more to take her through to
the west end siding. She’ll make it all right.”</p>

<p>“I know. But by Jasher! that ain’t railroading,”
insisted Connolly. “Two months ago you
wouldn’t find a single train crew on the Short Line
that’d take chances stealing sidings this way, and
now they’re all doing it. Besides, the tunnel’s all
tore up, with that electric-wiring gang working in
it, and every crew on the west end knows it.”</p>

<p>As he fumed, the despatcher rattled his key in
the call for Junico, the only night station west of
the tunnel at which there would be any chance of
communicating with the off time eastbound Fast
Mail. He knew it was only a chance. If the
Mail had made up no more than five of the
twenty minutes, it would already have passed
Junico.</p>

<p>At the close of the impatient call the circuit
broke and Junico “signed in.” Connolly asked
his question in clipped abbreviations, and got his
answer shot-like. “Number Six passing now.”
“<i>Hold Six</i>,” snapped the despatcher hurriedly.
For a full minute the sounder was silent. Then
it began again. “Chased out quick as I could,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>but couldn’t catch ’em,” was Junico’s incident-closing
reply.</p>

<p>Connolly pounded with a fat fist upon the plate-glass
top of his table in impotent wrath.</p>

<p>“There it is!” he gritted. “Now if anything
happens to get in the way of them cussed chance-takers
on Seventeen, there you are!”</p>

<p>Apparently there was nothing to be done but
to await the event and to hope for an auspicious
outcome. As Connolly had said, it wasn’t railroading;
and yet he knew well enough that on
many railroads the stealing of sidings, the crawling
up upon meeting-points by train crews hard
pressed to make their schedules, is a violation of
rules which is constantly winked at, and punished
only when trouble ensues.</p>

<p>In the present case there should have been no
trouble. With a clear thirty minutes in which to
make less than eight miles, the time freight should
be safely in on the siding at the west end of Tunnel
Number Three some minutes before the Fast Mail
could possibly cover its own intervening distance.</p>

<p>But on this particular Tuesday night the fates
were inauspicious. Fifteen minutes farther along,
after Johnson had gone back to his table in the corner,
Connolly’s west-wire sounder began to chatter
furiously. The fat despatcher broke in promptly,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>and again the trembling fit seized upon the unbusied
half of him.</p>

<p>“Oh, good Lord!” he groaned; and again:
“Oh, good <i>Lord</i>!” Then the corridor door opened
and Maxwell, the superintendent, came in, looking
as he always did, the square-shouldered,
square-jawed fighter of transportation battles,
with a few streaks of youthful gray beginning to
show in his tightly curled mustaches&mdash;a militant
figure of a man giving a truthful impression of the
fit and purposeful railroad field officer.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Dan?” he demanded, making
a quick push through the gate in the counter
railing.</p>

<p>Connolly explained hastily.</p>

<p>“Seventeen tried to steal a siding on Six. Gallagher,
the work-line operator at the electric gang’s
camp, has just called up to say that the freight’s
stuck in the tunnel&mdash;something off the track. A
flagman has come back to the camp with the news,
and he says the tunnel is blocked so they can’t get
through with a flag for Six.”</p>

<p>“Good God, Dan&mdash;they’ve <i>got</i> to get through!”
Maxwell exploded; and pushing the despatcher
aside he cut in on the wire himself. There was a
brief and brittle colloquy in which the emphatic
word was made to do duty for entire sentences, a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>wait, and when the clicking began again the superintendent
translated audibly, quite as if Connolly,
listening with all of his five senses concentrated
in the single one of hearing, were not taking the
hopeful information as it came from the sounder.</p>

<p>“Stribling’s there, and every sprinter in the
camp is turning out to do a Marathon over the
hill to the west end. Just the same, it will be touch
and go if they make it in time to warn the Mail.
How much late is Six?”</p>

<p>Connolly gave the time, making the proper deduction
for the few minutes made up west of
Junico. Maxwell glanced up at the time-standard
clock on the wall.</p>

<p>“There is an even chance,” he asserted hopefully.
“There ought to be somebody in that mob
of wire-stringers who can run the two miles in time
to head off the Mail. How did you come to let
things get into such a snarl as this, Dan?”</p>

<p>Again Connolly explained, and he did not try
to make it easy for the offending crew of Number
Seventeen. “Jasper didn’t ask for orders at
Nophi. He simply took snap judgment and went
along, leaving the Nophi man to tell me after the
thing was done.”</p>

<p>“Jasper and his engineer will get thirty days on
this, no matter how it turns out!” snapped the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>boss. “There is a good deal too much of this rule-breaking
lately, and it’s got to stop short. I won’t
have it.... Suffering cats! I wish those sprinters
would hurry up and get word to us! My God,
Dan, if that fast train gets into the tunnel before
they catch it&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>A thunderous clangor in the station yard below
the office windows cut into the sentence, and again
the superintendent looked up at the clock.</p>

<p>“That’s the ‘Quick-step,’ isn’t it?” he said.
“She’s bringing an old friend of ours from the East,
Dan&mdash;Mr. Sprague.”</p>

<p>For a moment Connolly was able to take his
mind off of the tragedy or near-tragedy which
was working itself out to some kind of a climax
in the far-away Hophra Mountains to the westward.</p>

<p>“You asked him to come and tell us why we’re
having this fit of extra cussedness all over the
line?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, no; the Department of Agriculture is
sending him to make some soil tests in the Timanyoni.
He writes that he is likely to be with us for
a month or two.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad,” said Connolly simply. “Somehow,
you feel as if you’d got a good solid mountain at
your back when Mr. Sprague’s around. I wonder
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>if he’ll come up here before he goes over to the
hotel?”</p>

<p>Even as he spoke the door opened, and the man
who looked like the elder brother of all the foot-ball
“backs” in the intercollegiate try-out came in.</p>

<p>“Hello, hello, hello,” he said jovially; “same
old shop&mdash;same old worries, eh? How are you,
Maxwell? And you, Mr. Connolly? Glad to see
you both. What’s the trouble this time? Anything
a journeyman chemist can help you out on?”</p>

<p>Maxwell’s mustaches took a sharper uptilt.
“How did you know there was any trouble, Calvin?”
he demanded quickly.</p>

<p>The big man leaned across the counter rail and
laughed softly.</p>

<p>“There is nothing very occult about that,” he
rejoined. “You have it written all over your
faces, both of you; and it is also written in the face
of that young man over in the corner, who would
like to hear what we’re saying and can’t quite compass
it.”</p>

<p>Maxwell explained briefly.</p>

<p>“Two of our trains are trying to get together on
a single track up at Tunnel Number Three in the
Hophras. There is a break-down in the tunnel,
and half a hundred men are sprinting over the
mountain to try to head off the other train.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span></p>

<p>“What? half a hundred? There ought to be
at least one or two good sprinters among that
many&mdash;somebody who can make your touch-down
for you. How does it come that you happened to
have as big a crowd as that on the side-lines&mdash;at
this time of night?”</p>

<p>The superintendent went into details far enough
to account for the crowd of volunteer rescuers.</p>

<p>“We are electrifying Tunnel Number Three, and
the contractors’ camp is at this end of the tunnel.
It was the contractors’ operator who sent in the
alarm, and his chief engineer turned out the entire
camp for us when I told him what to do.”</p>

<p>“And you are waiting to get word?”</p>

<p>“Yes; waiting and hoping. By great good luck
the Fast Mail is behind time. If it hasn’t made
up&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>A fierce clattering of the sounder on Connolly’s
table tore into the sentence, and in the midst of it
Maxwell shot out his arms and drew a deep breath.</p>

<p>“Thank God!” he ejaculated, “they’ve caught
the Mail! Now I’ll go with you, Calvin.” And
then to Connolly: “Straighten things out for
those fellows at the tunnel as quickly as you can,
Dan, and get the wheels in motion again. Order
up the engine from Second Seventeen if they need
power to get that raffle out of the tunnel, and have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>somebody send over to Lopez Canyon for Benson
to take charge. If you want to reach me, I’ll be
over at the hotel.”</p>

<p>At the Hotel Topaz, across the plaza from the
railroad head-quarters building, Maxwell saw his
friend and sometime college classmate properly
registered for a comfortable suite, and otherwise
hospitably provided for before the pair of them
went to smoke their bedtime pipes in the deserted
writing-room facing the plaza.</p>

<p>“It’s just my luck, Calvin, to be homeless about
every other time you happen along,” Maxwell
apologized, when the pipes were lighted. “Alice’s
father and mother came through from California
a few days ago, and carried her and the children
off with them to New York and the Long Island
shore. I’m a widower.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” laughed the big man. “I’m
going to be here in your midst for a month or
more, and I wouldn’t think of camping down on
you for that length of time, anyway. To-morrow
you’ll chase out and help me find a couple of office
rooms where I can set up a small laboratory; and
after that I’ll go out in the woods and dig dirt&mdash;which
it is my official nature so to do. That’s
enough about me. How are you getting along
with the railroad wreckers?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span></p>

<p>Maxwell lighted his pipe and answered categorically.</p>

<p>“We have heard nothing more, directly, from
the Wall Street people since that break they made
a few weeks ago trying to hold up the proxies I
was sending to President Ford in New York,” was
Maxwell’s summing up of the current situation.
“But Ford assures me from time to time that they
haven’t quit. The latest competition rate ruling
by the Interstate Commerce Commission makes it
absolutely necessary for them to own or control a
shorter line than their present one to Southern
California points&mdash;this in order to protect their
holdings in the big stock pool. They’d have what
they need if they could corral the Nevada Short
Line and tie it in with the Transcontinental’s
branch at Copah. Ford says they seem to consider
it only a question of time until they absorb
us. The T-C. people are spending a lot of money
on their Jack’s Canyon branch, putting it in shape
for heavy traffic; and they can’t hope to get
the traffic unless they get us.”</p>

<p>“This tunnel trouble to-night had nothing to do
with the fight, I suppose?” queried Sprague reflectively.</p>

<p>“Oh, no. That was merely the outgrowth of a
curious sort of letting down that comes once in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>a while on every railroad, no matter how well it
may be manned or handled. Our let-down has
been coming on gradually ever since we got over
the ‘Wire-Devil’ scare. Men, good men who have
been with us for years, take chances that would
make your hair stand on end. Like this to-night,”
and he went on to describe the causes
which had led up to the near-tragedy at Tunnel
Number Three.</p>

<p>“I see,” said Sprague. And then: “You say
you are electrifying? I thought that was a luxury
in which only the rich Eastern roads could indulge;
and then only for their city terminals.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t exactly a luxury in our case; it’s a working
necessity. Tunnel Number Three is part of a
shortening project carried out two years ago. It
dodges under Burnt Mountain and cuts out five
and two-tenths miles of the costliest, crookedest
track in Tumble-Tree Canyon; track that we were
never able to keep open for ten days in succession
during the summer season of cloud-bursts and
heavy storms. It is a timbered tunnel a mile and
a quarter long, and the greater part of it is through
loose, dry shale that practically kiln-dries the timber
arching. From the time we began using it
we’ve been fighting fire in it almost daily.”</p>

<p>“Just so,” said the chemistry expert. “So now
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>you are putting in electricity to get rid of the fire-throwing
locomotives. Where do you get your
juice?”</p>

<p>“In Lopez Canyon, about three miles from the
eastern portal, there is an excellent water-power.
Eventually we shall use electricity for the entire
hill-pull over the Hophras and so make a very
handsome reduction in our fuel account.”</p>

<p>“Good!” was the approving comment; and
then the commentator came back to the details.
“Electricity is another of my pet hobbies,” he
confessed. “What company is installing you&mdash;General
Electric?”</p>

<p>“No; a New York firm&mdash;Grafton Brothers. I
never heard of them until they came here.”</p>

<p>Only the keenest of observers would have noted
Sprague’s accession of interest at the mention of
the brotherly firm name.</p>

<p>“The Graftons, eh?” he said slowly. “How did
you come to give them the job?”</p>

<p>“We had nothing to do with it out here. The
deal was made in New York, with the Pacific
Southwestern officials.”</p>

<p>Sprague was nodding absently as if in answer to
some unspoken query of his own when he said,
“Have you ever met either of the Graftons, Dick?”</p>

<p>“No; they are only a name to me. Their representative
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>on our job is an engineer named
Stribling; a fine young fellow and a cracker-jack
in his business. He was the man who turned out
the crowd of sprinters for us to-night.”</p>

<p>“Oho! general favorite all around, is he?”</p>

<p>Maxwell laughed dryly. “He has captured
everybody except the one man who has had the
most to do with him; that’s Benson, our chief
engineer. Jack is a sort of two-fisted bluffer himself&mdash;though
it is only fair to say that he usually
makes his bluff good&mdash;and I think he’d always bet
on the field against a favorite. He says Stribling
is too smooth; too damned smooth, is the
way he generally phrases it.”</p>

<p>“I shall have great pleasure in making the acquaintance
of this Mr. Benson of yours some day,”
said the man from Washington. And after that
he smoked on in silence until Maxwell was about to
bid him good-night and suggest a bell-hop and the
elevator&mdash;did suggest them, in fact.</p>

<p>“No, I’m not sleepy,” was the rejoinder. “I
was just thinking about railroads and tunnels and
the like. If I were a railroad man, Dick, I believe
I should have a crazy horror of a tunnel.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know; superstition, perhaps.
You know the old saying:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span></p>

<p class="left no-indent">Every superstition<br />
Is a foolish superstition<br />
Save the little superstition<br />
&emsp;&emsp; Of me.</p>

<p class="no-indent">A tunnel always seems to me like a man’s neck.
One little grip and a squeeze, and your man,
though he may have a couple of hundred pounds
of other organs in perfect working order, is dead.”</p>

<p>Maxwell laughed at the quaint conceit, though
he was prompt to make the timely application.</p>

<p>“That would be true enough for us if Tunnel
Number Three should ever be wiped out,” he admitted.
“As I have said, it is in dry shale, a
good part of it, and it had to be carefully supported
by follow-up timbering as we went along
in the digging. I wanted Ford to let us keep the
roundabout track in commission, against emergencies,
but he decided it would be too expensive&mdash;as
it probably would have been.”</p>

<p>“And you have let the roundabout track
lapse?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; the cloud-bursts of the first summer
wiped it out for us completely.”</p>

<p>“So this tunnel is really the neck of your five-hundred-mile-long
man, is it?”</p>

<p>“It is. If Burnt Mountain should happen to
fall in on us one of these fine nights&mdash;which it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>won’t&mdash;we’d be definitely out of the game as a
through line. It would bottle us up for weeks, if
not for months.”</p>

<p>A slow smile spread itself over Sprague’s smooth-shaven,
good-natured face.</p>

<p>“If I had as tender a neck as that, Dick, I’d
have night sweats thinking about it; I should,
for a fact,” he averred. And then, after a pause:
“Ah; I’ve been waiting for that. The lights have
just gone out in your office over there in the railroad
building. Who is so industrious as to stay
on the job until nearly midnight?”</p>

<p>“It is Harvey Calmaine, my paragon of a chief
clerk. He’s a mighty hard-working young fellow&mdash;a
treasure, as you may remember. He has been
getting up some statistics for me, and he won’t
take the time out of the working day.”</p>

<p>“H’m, yes; he is a fine young fellow, Dick, and
no mistake.” Then, after he had refilled his pipe:
“He still limps a little from that foot-scorching
episode in Bart Holladay’s back room&mdash;when they
were torturing him to make him tell what he had
done with the proxies&mdash;doesn’t he?”</p>

<p>Maxwell turned upon his companion with a
frown of mystification wrinkling between his eyes.</p>

<p>“How did you know that, Calvin?” he demanded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span></p>

<p>Sprague chuckled gently.</p>

<p>“Some fine day, Dick, you’ll learn to use your
eyes and ears. I saw young Calmaine walking
across from the railroad building just now&mdash;as you
did, only you didn’t remark it consciously; and
at the present moment I hear him coming through
the lobby, with the limp very distinctly noticeable
in the click of his heels upon the tiled floor. And
now I’ll venture a guess: he is looking for you, and
when he finds you he will give you a telegram.”</p>

<p>Almost as he spoke, Calmaine came up behind
them. As Sprague had predicted, he had a telegram
in his hand, which he gave to his superior
with a word in explanation. “That is only a
translation. The original is a cipher, and I
locked it up in the office safe. It came just as I
was getting ready to knock off.”</p>

<p>Maxwell read the telegram and passed it on to
Sprague.</p>

<p>“It’s a little odd that Ford should use the same
figure of speech that you did a few minutes ago,”
he remarked. And then, with a short laugh, “If
I were inclined to be superstitious I might wonder
if your marvellous second mentality wasn’t looking
over Calmaine’s shoulder as he translated
that.”</p>

<p>Sprague had glanced at the message. It read:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="no-indent">“Big Nine still feeling for a strangle-hold on us.
Look sharp that it does not get its fingers on your
windpipe.</p>

<p class="no-indent right2">“<span class="smcap">Ford.</span>”</p>
</div>

<p>The big man passed the square of paper back
to his friend and stood up to stretch his arms over
his head, yawning like a sleepy farm-hand.</p>

<p>“I’ve got to set up my shop and go to work
sometime to-morrow,” he said. “Let’s go upstairs
and turn in for a few lines of sleep.”</p>

<p>“Not me, just yet,” said Maxwell, with a curt
disregard for his English. “I’m going over to the
shack for a little while.”</p>

<p>“What for?” questioned the sleepy one, with
half-absent interest.</p>

<p>“To try and get Benson on the wire and have
him post guards in that tunnel. There is no reason
on earth for it, but between you and Ford
you’ve got me nervous on this choking proposition.
Good-night, old man. Breakfast with me
in the morning, and afterward I’ll take you out and
steer you up against some of the real-estate robbers
and get them to find you an office.”</p>

<p>On the following day the superintendent was
as good as his word in the office-finding matter,
and by noon the Government soil-tester was comfortably
established in a couple of rooms on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>second floor of the Kinzie Building, in the same
corridor with Mr. Robert Stillings, the local attorney
for the railroad company.</p>

<p>The two-room suite gave him an office&mdash;which
he said was about as necessary as an auxiliary tail
to a cat&mdash;and a second room in the rear which he
speedily transformed into a working laboratory,
using the young man named Tarbell, who still
figured on the railroad pay-rolls as a “relief operator,”
for his errand-boy and man-of-all-work in
securing the needed furnishings and equipment.</p>

<p>Later in the day Maxwell brought his brother-in-law,
“Billy” Starbuck, around to the new office,
introducing him as a mine owner and a gentleman
of easy leisure, and one who knew every square
acre of soil, arable or otherwise, in the entire
Timanyoni.</p>

<p>“Billy has nothing on earth to do, and, like me,
he is a temporary widower,” Maxwell explained.
“We married sisters, and his wife has gone with
mine and the Fairbairns to dabble in the salt sea
waves at Norman Towers. Make use of him as
you can, only don’t take his word for the gentleness
of the horse you’re going to ride. He is an
absolutely truthful man on any other subject,
but he never misses a chance to play a bucking
bronc’ against a tenderfoot.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span></p>

<p>Sprague foregathered at once with the clean-cut,
rather shabbily clothed young mine owner
whose principal affectations were his worn khaki
suit, a cowboy Stetson tilted carelessly to the back
of his head, and a vocabulary of cow-camp slang
which happened to be no measure of his knowledge
of grammatical English. Before he left the newly
established laboratory in the Kinzie Building,
Starbuck had engaged to go with the expert on a
soil-collecting trip through the Park, the trip to
begin early in the morning of the following day,
and to continue indefinitely; or until the chief
soil-hunter should be sufficiently saddle-sore to
wish to cut it short.</p>

<p>“I like that brother-in-law of yours a whole
heap, Dick,” was Sprague’s verdict when he met
the superintendent at dinner in the Topaz café
that evening. “He is a man with a history,
isn’t he?”</p>

<p>The queer look which Sprague seemed to be able
to evoke at will in his table-mate crept into Maxwell’s
eyes.</p>

<p>“Did you ever meet Billy before I took him
into your office this afternoon?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Ever hear of him before?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span></p>

<p>“All right; now I’m going to try you out good
and hard. You intimate that he is a man with a
history. What is his history?”</p>

<p>The expert sat back, thrust his hands into his
pockets, and for a moment seemed to go into a
trance, with his gaze fixed upon the ornate decorations
of the café ceiling.</p>

<p>“I’ll make what you will probably call a series
of wild guesses,” he said at length, “prefacing
them with the assurance, which you must take at
its face value, that Mr. Starbuck has told me nothing
whatever of himself&mdash;at least, not consciously.”</p>

<p>“Go on,” said Maxwell.</p>

<p>“In the first place, he is an educated man&mdash;a
college man&mdash;and he talks cowboy English only
because it suits his fancy to talk it. Also, though
he wears khaki and a cowboy hat, he is quite as
much at home in evening clothes as you or I.
Am I right, so far?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Beyond that, he is a man of many accomplishments,
most of which he is at some pains to conceal.
In his younger youth, if not later, he was
a bit wild&mdash;too much money to spend, I take it&mdash;and
the wildness, or some of its consequences,
landed him in jail; no, it wasn’t a jail&mdash;it was a
penitentiary.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span></p>

<p>Maxwell’s look of amused half-triumph had
changed to one of sober consternation.</p>

<p>“<i>Calvin!</i>” he exclaimed, in low tones. “You
must know; you must have heard&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I pledge you my word, Dick; I am cutting this
out of whole cloth, so far as any outside information
is concerned. But let me go on. Whatever
Mr. Starbuck was, or whatever he did, he was never
a criminal in the true sense of the word. So far
from it, I can assure you of what you doubtless
know for yourself; that he is a man to tie to&mdash;a
true man and a loyal friend and kinsman. I’m going
to take the field with him to-morrow morning,
and we shall come back brothers of the blood.
That’s a measure of my regard for him.”</p>

<p>Maxwell put down his knife and fork and said
what clansman relationship demanded.</p>

<p>“Listen,” he began, “and see how frightfully
near you have shaved the truth in your ‘guesses.’
In his early manhood Billy was a cowpunch&mdash;in
the college-graduate class, as you intimate. He
discovered a mine, sold it for a fat wad, and went
to New York, where he blew in the wad to the
final dollar.”</p>

<p>Sprague nodded. “That was the wild side-step
that I couldn’t quite place,” he said, and the superintendent
went on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span></p>

<p>“When his money was gone he went to work as
a stenographer for a firm of brokers, and was holding
the job down when the safe was tapped and
a sum of money stolen. He was arrested, tried,
and sentenced to a term in Sing Sing, where he
served his time. It was late in the first year of
his freedom before a few of us who were his friends
here in the West found out that he had voluntarily
gone to prison to save a fellow-clerk&mdash;a half-dead,
broken-down scoundrel with a wife and children,
a sick mother, and a crippled sister.”</p>

<p>“Fine!” Sprague was beginning to say; but
Maxwell interposed.</p>

<p>“No, hold on; you mustn’t set him down as an
impossible hero. He’d be the first to object to
that. I said ‘voluntarily,’ and it really amounted
to that, though when Billy promised not to betray
the scoundrel he had no idea that he was going
to be made to suffer in his place. Nevertheless,
since the promise had been given, Billy made
good.”</p>

<p>Sprague smiled. “Entirely without prejudice
to a hearty and man-sized hatred for the man who
let him go in the hole, you’d say?”</p>

<p>“Exactly; entirely without prejudice to that
very human passion.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the expert; “my summing up was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>true, anyhow. I was sure he had that kind of
stuff in him, and that he had been tried out along
some such line as that.”</p>

<p>Maxwell nodded, and then he became insistent.</p>

<p>“Now tell me&mdash;you’ve got to tell me, Calvin,
how you did it.”</p>

<p>Sprague’s mellow, booming laugh earned him
more than one curious glance from the surrounding
tables.</p>

<p>“I can no more tell you, Dick, than I can explain
why, to a majority of people, white is white
and black is black. For my own satisfaction I
define the ‘how’ as a natural growth, favored by
habit and training, of the scientific attitude; the
mental slant which, if given free play, almost
unconsciously notes, marks, deduces, reasons;
deeming nothing too small or too trifling to go
toward making up the whole of any conclusion.
More than that, in my own case the faculty is
able to hold itself workably aloof from the ordinary
distractions of conversation and the like. It
goes on, using the outward senses when it needs
them, to be sure, but only as aids to the developing
of its own little film in its own little darkroom.
Do you get the idea?”</p>

<p>“Only partly. Even science has to have its
raw materials to work on.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, yes; and the materials lie all around us
constantly, if we only know how to weigh and
measure them. In Starbuck’s case, now, there
were little lapses from the cowboy talk to tell me
that he was an educated man; also, he has the
true modesty of those who can really do things.
Then there were gaps in his talk, little loopholes,
you might call them, through which I could look
back through the years and get glimpses of that
period of dissipation. Each glimpse revealed a
tiny ear-mark of the man who knows&mdash;who can
only know&mdash;because he has been there.”</p>

<p>“Go on,” urged Maxwell, still only half-convinced
that the deductions were not, in the
last analysis, only shrewd guesses. “None of
these things told you that he had been in prison.”</p>

<p>“No; as to that, I’ll admit I set a harmless
trap for him. I fancied once, and then again,
that I saw the prison look in his eye; the quick
side-glance that a long-term prisoner learns to
give without turning his head&mdash;notice it the next
time you happen to be in a penitentiary, if you are
ever so unfortunate as to visit one.”</p>

<p>“I have noticed it,” said Maxwell, and the expert
went on.</p>

<p>“When I saw that, the scientific mentality said
instantly, ‘That look wasn’t acquired in a jail
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>term&mdash;it took longer.’ The next suggestion followed
as a matter of course. Every long-term
man answers to a number instead of to his name.
At the moment I was numbering the bottles of
chemicals which Tarbell had been buying for me,
and I turned the talk upon my peculiar system of
labelling&mdash;by numbers. Starbuck himself did the
rest. He said, ‘I reckon I wouldn’t rent even a
post-office box if it had to have a number on it.’
That was all, but it was enough.”</p>

<p>Maxwell was toying with his dessert.</p>

<p>“As I have said several times before, Calvin,
you are almost uncanny now and then. You
know too much. Some fine day it will strike in
on you&mdash;sour on you and make you sick.”</p>

<p>Sprague’s mellow laugh sounded again.</p>

<p>“I haven’t begun to tell you all I know. For
example, I might say that all through this spell of
gossip about your brother-in-law you’ve been giving
the subject no more than a scant half of your
mind. The other half has been tussling with
your railroad involvement, and you’ve been wondering
where the Big Nine is going to land on you
next. What do you hear from Tunnel Number
Three?”</p>

<p>“Nothing much; or at least nothing out of the
ordinary. They got the tangle straightened out
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>last night after a time. Benson wires that Stribling
put the entire electrifying force under his orders,
and was all kinds of nice about it.”</p>

<p>“‘Electrifying,’” repeated Sprague musingly.
“A slight change in the spelling would make it
‘electrocuting,’ wouldn’t it? How long will it be
before the installation is completed?”</p>

<p>“They are starting the turbines in Lopez Canyon
to-day, for a try-out. The wires are all
strung, and Stribling is installing some sort of a
safety contrivance in the tunnel as a finishing
touch; a switch of some kind that will shunt the
current in case any accident should happen to a
train in transit. It’s all Greek to me&mdash;and to
Benson, for that matter. Neither of us knows
enough about electric installations to keep us
from spoiling.”</p>

<p>“But the date,” said Sprague, with the amiable
persistence which was one of his chief characteristics.
“When will the current be turned on?”</p>

<p>“Stribling sends word that he will be ready to
cut the power in on the tunnel wires to-morrow
evening at six o’clock, and asks if I’m going to be
on hand to see it done.”</p>

<p>Sprague was deftly clipping the tip from one of
the cigars which the waiter had brought, preparatory
to lighting it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span></p>

<p>“Do you happen to have a time-table in your
pocket?” he asked.</p>

<p>Maxwell had one, and he passed it across the
table. The Government man postponed the lighting
of his cigar and began to turn the leaves of the
official schedule hand-book. At the pages listing
the trains on the Hophra Division he paused and
ran his finger slowly down the columns giving the
movement of traffic to and through Tunnel Number
Three.</p>

<p>“You would have to leave here early in the
afternoon to reach the tunnel by six&mdash;or rather to
be there at six&mdash;wouldn’t you?” he asked, returning
the time-table.</p>

<p>Maxwell shook his head and smiled. “You
forget that I’m not tied to regular trains on my
own piece of railroad,” he suggested. “I couldn’t
afford to go up on Three and spend two or three
hours loafing around. If I go, I shall order out a
car and engine and make a quick job of it. It
is only sixty-three miles, and I can make it special
in an hour and thirty minutes or thereabouts.”</p>

<p>“I see,” said Sprague reflectively. “Leaving
Brewster about three-thirty, say?”</p>

<p>“Yes; that would be plenty early enough.”</p>

<p>“But you don’t know yet whether you will go
at all?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span></p>

<p>“No. There is a delegation of ore-shippers
coming down from Red Butte to-morrow, and I’ll
be busy with it a good part of the day.”</p>

<p>After that the talk drifted to other things,
among them the expert’s mission to the Timanyoni,
which, he admitted in confidence, was the preliminary
to a possible Government reclamation
project. And finally, when Maxwell broke away
to go back to his office across the plaza, his going
or not going to the tunnel to be present at the
turning on of the power current on the following
day was left undecided.</p>

<p>According to the prearranged programme,
Sprague left Brewster at daylight the next morning,
riding with Starbuck to the upper valley of the
Gloria where the first of the soil specimens were to
be collected. But for some reason, saddle-soreness
on the part of the tenderfoot, or another, the
trip was a short one, ending a little after noon,
when the two came jogging back through the
Brewster streets.</p>

<p>From their corner table in the Topaz café, where
they ate their late luncheon together, they saw
Maxwell entertaining a party of the ore-shippers;
and later Sprague, whose half-absent gaze seemed
to miss nothing, saw a good-looking young fellow
in shabby, work-stained brown duck push through
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>the swinging glazed doors opening from the lobby
and go around to whisper to Maxwell at the table
of entertainment. Sprague called his companion’s
attention to the new-comer.</p>

<p>“That will be Mr. Benson, chief engineer of the
railroad, for a guess,” he ventured; and Starbuck
nodded.</p>

<p>“Right you are. It’s Jack; and to look at him
you sure wouldn’t think he was a married man,
with a nice, tidy little wife at home, would you,
now? He always looks as if he had just tumbled
out of the dirtiest car in his work-train.”</p>

<p>The soil expert smiled leniently. “Possibly he
is here on business, and sometimes business won’t
wait,” he suggested. “See; your brother-in-law
is excusing himself to the ore people and is going
out with Benson. After we finish our luncheon
I’ll ask you to do me a little favor, Mr. Starbuck.
Find Mr. Maxwell and tell him we’re back&mdash;just
on the chance that he didn’t see us over here in
this dark corner of ours. I’d like to meet Mr.
Benson, if it can be managed without too much
trouble.”</p>

<p>Starbuck’s keen gray eyes searched the round,
double-chinned face of his newly made acquaintance
shrewdly.</p>

<p>“I reckon I’m on,” he said slowly. “I was beginning
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>to climb on before you said anything.
That New York crowd is after Dick and his railroad
with a black-snake whip; I know that much.
Is the whip getting ready to pop again?”</p>

<p>“I’m a little afraid it is, Mr. Starbuck, and I am
hoping that Mr. Benson will be able to tell us
whether it is or isn’t,” was the even-toned rejoinder.
“At all events, I’d like to meet him and
have a talk with him&mdash;some time before three
o’clock. Bear the hour in mind, will you, please?
and try to arrange it for me.”</p>

<p>“Sure,” said Starbuck; and when they rose
from the table he went in search of the superintendent
and Benson, leaving his luncheon companion
to go around to the Kinzie Building laboratory
alone.</p>

<p>It was something less than half an hour after
Sprague had stripped his coat and gone to work
on the soil specimens of the morning’s gathering
when Starbuck came in, bringing Maxwell and
Benson. As Starbuck made it appear, the visit
was merely a neighborly drop-in, with no better
excuse than the expressed purpose of introducing
Sprague to a possible helper.</p>

<p>“I thought you might be able to use Jack
in some way, Mr. Sprague,” he said, after the
introduction was a fact accomplished. “He sure
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>knows a heap more about Timanyoni dirt than
anybody else between the two ranges; carries
right smart of it around on his clothes a good deal
of the time.”</p>

<p>Benson took the joke in good part; and when
Sprague had found and opened a box of his irreproachable
cigars, the talk, touching lightly at
first upon Sprague’s business in the West, came
around, or was brought around, to Benson’s part
in the electrification job. The big expert with the
fighting jaw and the sympathetic gray eyes had a
way of leading even a reticent man to tell of his
troubles; and Benson, knowing the part Sprague
had taken in defeating the two previous attempts
to wreck the Short Line, felt free to unburden
himself.</p>

<p>“I can’t make Maxwell, here, believe that Stribling
is anything but the fine, open-handed young
fellow that he seems to be; but I want to tell you
three together what I have often told Maxwell:
I’ve got a hunch. I don’t <i>know</i> a blessed thing.
Stribling has always treated me fine, and he is a
fellow you can hardly help cottoning to, right from
the jump. But some way something inside of me
keeps on telling me that he’s too smooth&mdash;too
damned smooth. Last night, for instance, in that
derailment muddle&mdash;there wasn’t anything he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>wouldn’t do, didn’t do, to help us out. He packed
his men into the tunnel so thick that nobody could
get near that derailed car; in fact, he had the car
on the rails and the train backing out before I
could get any action at all.”</p>

<p>“What caused the derailment, Mr. Benson?”
Sprague put in quietly.</p>

<p>“That was one of the things that made me hot.
Stribling’s messing in made it impossible for anybody
to tell. There was nothing the matter with
the track or with the car, so far as I could see after
the thing was over. Bamberg, the engineer who
was pulling the train, swears that somebody
flagged him down with a red light when he was
about half-way through the tunnel, and he stopped.
Then the red changed to white and gave him the
‘go-ahead.’ When he tried to start his train, this
box-car, somewhere along in the middle of things,
jumped the track and blocked the tunnel. He
felt the jerk and stopped again.”</p>

<p>Sprague waved a hand in token of his complete
satisfaction.</p>

<p>“Suppose we ignore this train tangle for the
present and come to other things,” he interposed.
“I’ve been wondering if you could describe for me,
briefly, the details of this tunnel installation, Mr.
Benson?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span></p>

<p>“Why, yes; it’s simple enough&mdash;it’s merely a
trolley line on a big scale: two heavy copper
trolley wires strung through on catenary brackets,
with double insulation. That’s all, except the
safety-switches&mdash;cut-outs&mdash;one at each end and
one in the middle of the tunnel.”</p>

<p>“Ah?” said the expert, mildly interested at last;
“one in the middle, you say? What is that for?”</p>

<p>“It is the real safety device, Stribling says; the
others are merely mechanical cut-outs for the use
of the wire repairers. He was explaining it to me
this morning when he was connecting it in with the
power wires. It’s an ordinary oil-protected switch
so adjusted that in case an accident happens to a
train in the tunnel the circuit will be broken automatically
and the live-wire current cut out. It’s a
good thing, you’d say. It would make your flesh
creep to think what it would mean to have those
high-power wires short-circuiting into a wreck.”</p>

<p>“We won’t think of it,” said the big man quizzically.
“We’ll think rather of this Mr. Stribling
and your&mdash;thus far&mdash;unexplained suspicions. How
did he contrive to send you down here to-day?”</p>

<p>Benson looked up quickly.</p>

<p>“How did you know he sent me? I didn’t say
he did, did I? But I guess that is what it amounts
to. He made it a sort of personal matter; urged
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>me to come and bring Mr. Maxwell back with me;
said that on a job as big as ours he didn’t want to
take any chances with his reputation as an electrical
engineer or leave any room for a misunderstanding.
He’d like to have Maxwell go foot by
foot over the installation and see that everything
is all right and safe before the power is turned on
and the first electric train is sent through.”</p>

<p>Sprague put his face in his hands and for a few
seconds the silence in the makeshift laboratory
was unbroken. Then suddenly he came to life
again.</p>

<p>“You were telling us about this internal safety
device,” he broke out abruptly. “It’s an oil-switch,
you say?”</p>

<p>“Yes; there is an iron tank to hold the oil,
and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hold on; where do you find room in the tunnel
for a tank?”</p>

<p>“In one of the side excavations. When we were
driving the tunnel we left side niches every two
hundred feet or so; safety-holes for the men in
blasting, and places where we could store dynamite
and tools out of danger and out of the way.”</p>

<p>“Stop. Was this particular dodge-hole where
the safety switch is placed ever used for dynamite
storing?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span></p>

<p>“Yes; there are a lot of empty boxes in it now.
In the arching, the timber-setters had covered
them in, I suppose, and they were overlooked in
the cleaning out.”</p>

<p>“You are sure they are empty?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; they’re empty all right. Stribling
called my attention to them this morning, and I
kicked over two or three of them, at his suggestion,
just to make sure that they were empty.”</p>

<p>“I see; he called your attention to them, did
he? That is interesting, but not nearly as interesting
as this oil-switch you’ve been trying to
describe for me. Go over it again, will you?”</p>

<p>The young chief engineer was evidently disappointed.
The scientist of whose gifts he had heard
so much seemed to have a brain in which pertinacity,
the pertinacity which clings helplessly to
trivial and perfectly obvious things, was the over-shadowing
faculty.</p>

<p>“I don’t know that I can make it any plainer,”
he said, with a touch of impatience. “It’s just an
ordinary electric circuit-breaker, the same as they
use on street-cars, and it is buried in oil to keep
it from arcing&mdash;as all switches are when they’re
under voltages as high as ours will be. The mechanism
is suspended in a tank by its own wires,
and the tank is filled with oil. I was there when
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>they were filling the tank this morning, and Stribling
poured a queer sirupy mess in on top of it&mdash;some
patent stuff to keep the oil from thickening
under exposure, he said.”</p>

<p>“A patent mixture, eh? I’m interested in
patents,” said the listener, going off at another
of the blind tangents. “How did it come&mdash;in
a can?”</p>

<p>“Yes; in four square cans, holding about a
gallon or so each, I should say. They were
packed in a box&mdash;like varnish cans, you know&mdash;only
they were taller and not so big in section.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you weren’t near enough to notice
any name or advertisement on these cans, were
you?”</p>

<p>Benson had by this time lost all hope of finding
anything like continuity in the big man’s mind,
but he answered the query.</p>

<p>“Yes, I was near enough; Stribling was up on
the tank and I passed the cans up to him, one at a
time&mdash;and spilled the stuff all over me doing it.
There wasn’t any name on them. They were just
plain square tin cans; that’s all.”</p>

<p>Sprague got up and crossed over to Benson’s
chair.</p>

<p>“Spilled it on you, eh? Is this the stain of it on
your coat?” he asked; and when Benson nodded:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>“It’s too bad to spoil a perfectly good working-coat
that way. Suppose you let me have it and
I’ll see if I can’t take those spots out of it.”</p>

<p>Benson obeyed, half-contemptuously, and, together
with the two who had taken no part in the
colloquy, looked on curiously while the expert, who
had apparently lost all interest in everything save
the coat-cleaning, swiftly treated the stained
patches with various chemicals, put the resultant
washings into a beaker and began to add ingredients
from sundry bottles on the laboratory shelves,
holding the beaker to the light after each fresh
addition to note if there were changing colors in
the solution.</p>

<p>At the close of the rapidly conducted experiment
he poured a little of the solution into a tiny test-tube,
which he proceeded to heat over the flame
of a small alcohol lamp. This part of whatever
experiment he was attempting appeared to be
unsuccessful. Almost immediately the test-tube
cracked with a miniature explosion, scattering bits
of broken glass and extinguishing the flame of the
little lamp.</p>

<p>Sprague tossed the neck of the shattered glass
tube aside and returned the brown-duck shooting-coat
to its owner. Benson put it on, and was curious
enough to say: “Did you think you could find
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>out what Stribling’s protective mixture was from
those grease-spots?”</p>

<p>“Mere force of habit,” laughed the chemist,
putting on his own coat. “I’m obliged to analyze
everything I get hold of, you know; it’s a sort of
disease with me, I guess.”</p>

<p>“But could you tell what it was, just from those
discolored washings?” queried Maxwell.</p>

<p>“Perfectly. Mr. Stribling’s ‘patent’ is a compound
in which the chief ingredient is a grease
derived from the spent lye of the soap-makers,
and one of the principal uses of which in the arts
is, as Mr. Stribling says, to keep oils, and other
things, from drying out.” Then, more pointedly
to the superintendent: “I suppose you’ll go up
to the tunnel and look the job over, making our
careful young friend Stribling entirely happy,
won’t you?”</p>

<p>Maxwell looked at his watch.</p>

<p>“Perhaps I’d better. Benson wants to get back,
anyway. Will you two go along?”&mdash;to Sprague
and Starbuck.</p>

<p>“I don’t mind,” said the expert, with a barely
perceptible nod to Starbuck; and after he had rearranged
the chemicals on his newly made shelves
the four left the office and had themselves dropped
to the ground floor of the building.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span></p>
<p>It was while they were walking two and two down
the street that Sprague dropped a few steps behind
with Starbuck and passed him a carefully wrapped
package which he took from under his coat.</p>

<p>“I have another little experiment in mind, Mr.
Starbuck,” he said in low tones. “When we are
on our way through the tunnel, watch your opportunity
to drop out of the procession long
enough to empty the contents of that package into
the patent grease, which you will find, not floating
on the oil, but in some sort of a receptacle let into
the top of the oil-tank of that safety contrivance
which Mr. Benson has so accurately described for
us. I’m curious enough to want to prove up on my
analysis of a few minutes ago&mdash;to see if it was correct.”</p>

<p>“What will happen if it was correct?”</p>

<p>“Nothing; nothing alarming, I assure you.
But be careful not to get any of the stuff in that
package on your hands when you break the paraffin
seals. And perhaps it might be as well if you
don’t let our young electrical friend see you do it.
He might think we were messing in where we had
no business to.”</p>

<p>Starbuck made a sign of complete understanding,
and a few minutes later, when they reached
the main street, made a time-saving suggestion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span></p>

<p>“Suppose you folks take a taxi to the roundhouse,”
he said. “I’ll mosey up to the despatcher’s
office and get your clear-track orders for
you.”</p>

<p>Maxwell approved the suggestion and they
separated, Starbuck catching a passing electric
car for the plaza-fronting railroad head-quarters,
and Maxwell impressing the first auto hack he
could find to take the remaining three of them
directly to the western yards. The hackman
drove across the city and let them out at the
nearest street-crossing, and from thence they
walked the final hundred yards over the ties of the
shop track.</p>

<p>At the roundhouse door they met a big,
bearded man whose carefully creased brown hat
and rather vociferous business suit would have
marked him elsewhere as a gentleman of elegant,
if somewhat precarious, leisure. Judson Bascom
was this gentleman’s name, and he was comparatively
a new-comer in the Short Line service;
having been appointed to succeed Fred Dawson,
master mechanic, promoted.</p>

<p>Bascom was stooping to pat a stray dog, but he
rose to his feet when the three came down upon
him.</p>

<p>“You’re the man we’re looking for, Bascom,”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>said Maxwell shortly. “I want a light engine to
go up to Tunnel Number Three. What have you
got in?”</p>

<p>The big master mechanic twiddled the bunch
of charms on his watch-fob, and the stray dog began
to sniff warily at Benson’s heels.</p>

<p>“The Nine-fifteen’s got fire in her; will she do?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Get me a crew as quickly as you can. I
want a man who isn’t afraid to run.”</p>

<p>The man in the brown hat and the loud plaids
dragged out a fat gold watch and shook his head.</p>

<p>“I guess that’ll be me. There’s nobody ’round,
and I suppose you wouldn’t want to wait until I
can send the caller out after somebody?”</p>

<p>“No; I’m in a hurry,” snapped the boss. “Let’s
get a move. My car is in the shop, so you can
couple onto that caboose over there on the split
track. There are four of us to go, and we’d crowd
you in the cab.”</p>

<p>Big and leisurely-looking as he was, the master
mechanic made good time. In a minute or two
he had the smart, light eight-wheeler on the turntable,
with the blower roaring, a red-headed pit-boy
to fire, and half a dozen roundhouse men
to put their shoulders to the table-levers. The
shifting took five minutes more; and by that time
a switching-engine, with Starbuck hanging from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>the step, came racing down the yard from the
mile-away head-quarters.</p>

<p>Starbuck swung off before the switcher came to
a stop, and joined the three who were waiting at
the step of the caboose.</p>

<p>“Hell’s a-poppin’,” he said laconically. “Davis
hasn’t got a single west wire that he can use. They
all went out, blink, about twenty minutes ago.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” demanded Maxwell. “Not all
of them, surely!”</p>

<p>“Every blamed one&mdash;commercial wires and all.
Can’t get a whisper out of anything west of Little
Butte. He says it acts like a general ‘ground,’
and then again it don’t.”</p>

<p>The nattily dressed master mechanic had
dropped from his engine-step to come and join
the group at the caboose. Maxwell put him in
possession of the blockading fact in a brief sentence.</p>

<p>“The wires are dead and we’ll have to bluff our
way from siding to siding. Are you game for it,
Bascom?”</p>

<p>The big man inclined his head. “I guess so,”
he said.</p>

<p>“All right. Go to Little Butte for the first lap.
There is nothing in the way between here and the
junction. All aboard, gentlemen.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span></p>

<p>The start was made briskly enough, but two
miles beyond the yard-limits the caboose-car
chucked noisily as Bascom slowed for the single-span
bridge over the Gloria.</p>

<p>“Good Gad!” raged Maxwell, jumping up and
jerking the air-whistle cord for full speed ahead.
“If he’s going to slow up for every trestle we come
to, we’ll never get anywhere!”</p>

<p>“We can prod him,” said Benson.</p>

<p>For the few miles intervening between the bridge
and Little Butte the master mechanic did not
need prodding. Taking the air-whistle hint for
what it meant, he hurled the wild train around the
curves and over the tangents wholly without regard
for the comfort of the four men who vainly
tried to keep their seats on the bunk benches in
the caboose. At Silver Switch the landscape was
merely a blur; and in rounding the great side-cut
at the Butte bluff the short car shrieked and
groaned and seemed to be riding like a toe-balancer
on the outer rail.</p>

<p>At the Little Butte stop the four made a dash
for the operator’s office, where Bascom presently
joined them. There was no information to be
got out of Wooffert, the station agent. His wires
were working north on the Red Butte branch,
but there was a dead “ground” somewhere to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>the westward. Broken snatches were still coming
through from Caliger, ten miles up the main line
west, and the instruments acted as if somebody
had been pouring cold molasses into them.</p>

<p>Maxwell had his pocket time-card out, though he
did not need to consult it. “Sixteen and Eighteen
are somewhere between here and Nophi,” he
announced. “We’ve got to find and pass them as
we can. Let her go, Bascom.”</p>

<p>A half-minute later the up-valley race was begun.
In the lower reaches the tangents were
long, giving the volunteer engineer measurably
safe sights ahead; and there was no occasion for
Maxwell to jerk the whistle cord. Again the big
man in the engine cab was hurling the train along
with small regard for anything but speed.</p>

<p>At Caliger another stop was made. Like the
man at Little Butte, the operator knew nothing
save that his wires were dead. At his last report
both of the down-coming freight trains had been
on time. Maxwell did some quick figuring.</p>

<p>“We’re pretty safe to run to Hatcher’s,” he told
Bascom. “That will give us five minutes against
Sixteen, provided she’s not running ahead of her
schedule. Can you make Hatcher’s in forty
minutes?”</p>

<p>“I’ll make it or land this outfit in hell,” said
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>the master mechanic grittingly. And once again
the wheels began to spin.</p>

<p>It proved to be a close call at Hatcher’s, the
little “blind” siding in the upper valley. One
mile short of the passing track Bascom began to
blow his whistle like a madman, and the four on
the caboose, leaning far out on the platforms,
saw a long freight lumbering down from the west.
A short, stabbing puff of steam from the freight
locomotive’s whistle, soundless because of the din
of hammering wheels and shrieking flanges, told
them that the freight engineer had seen and heard
and was trying to stop. Also, it was apparent
to the two who looked on with railroad knowledge
that the stop could not be made within the siding’s
switch limits.</p>

<p>Bascom took a chance and a risky one. Speeding
like a fiend, he sent his one-car train onward
to what promised to be a smashing head-on collision
with the freight. But at the lower switch,
with the slowing freight less than three hundred
yards away, he made a grinding stop; his fireman
leaped from the gangway and ran to turn the
switch; and an instant later the wild train was
snatched in on the siding and the freight was rolling
past in safety over the reset switch.</p>

<p>“Good work!” said Sprague, speaking for the
first time since the departure from Little Butte.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>“This man Bascom may not be the heavy villain
that he looks to be, but he is certainly carrying his
nerve with him this afternoon.”</p>

<p>Maxwell was leaning out and shouting to the
volunteer in the cab.</p>

<p>“Easy, Bascom!” he yelled; “they’re carrying
green!”</p>

<p>Bascom looked back and nodded; and the red-headed
fireman strolled on ahead to take his stand
at the upper switch.</p>

<p>“Anything significant about the St. Patrick’s
Day color?” queried Sprague; and Maxwell said
there was.</p>

<p>“It means another section following,” he explained;
and then: “Here it comes!” And as he
said it, another freight came into view, plunging
around the curves toward the siding.</p>

<p>Unhappily for the speed-making purpose, this
train, too, was carrying green, and Maxwell swore
impatiently to the universe in general. “Three
sections to this; and Eighteen’s pretty sure to
have two or more. It’s three fifty-five, right
now, and we’ve got thirty miles to go!”</p>

<p>Benson laughed.</p>

<p>“Stribling will wait until the last minute for
you, never fear. With two hours we could mighty
near get out and walk it.”</p>

<p>“I reckon we’re going to get a chance to walk a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>piece of the way,” said Starbuck in his slow drawl.
“That maverick choo-choo wrangler up ahead will
have us in the ditch before he hits the Nophi
grades, if he keeps up his lick.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to call him down,” said Maxwell,
dubiously. “He’s probably got a grouch because
I pulled the string on him back yonder at the Gloria
bridge.”</p>

<p>“There comes the third section!” Benson called
out; and a minute afterward the third and last
division of the overland freight went hurtling past
on the main track.</p>

<p>Bascom’s makeshift fireman was promptly on
his job. While the tail-end of the third section was
clanking over the frogs he jerked the switch, and
at the same instant the master mechanic jerked
the throttle of the Nine-fifteen. The wild train
shot out into position on the main line, halted for
the fraction of a minute needed to enable the fireman
to run up and scramble to the footboard, and
the breakneck race was continued.</p>

<p>By this time none of the four thought of going
back into the caboose. They were crowded together
upon the front platform, ready to make the
leap for life which seemed momentarily imminent
as Bascom snatched the short car recklessly around
the curves and over the switches at the various
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>stations. Train Number Eighteen, also a through
freight, was scheduled one hour behind Sixteen;
but in the absence of all wire reports of its progress,
nobody knew just where it would be found.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, it was met between two
sidings, ten miles on the hither side of Nophi;
and, happily for the safety of all concerned, the
meeting with the first section chanced upon a
piece of straight track&mdash;one of the exceedingly few
tangents in the rough, gulch-like valley known as
Tumble-Tree Canyon. As before, Bascom held
his whistle open, and, thanks to the brakes and a
liberal sanding of the rails, a collision was averted.</p>

<p>When the two locomotives were nose to nose,
and a flagman was racing frantically back to flag
the following section, Maxwell sprang off and fell
upon the conductor of the freight.</p>

<p>“How many sections of you?” he demanded explosively.</p>

<p>“Two,” said the man, putting up an arm as if
he expected to be hit.</p>

<p>“How close are you?” was the next shot-like
question.</p>

<p>“That’s them, comin’ now,” said the conductor,
as a hoarse whistle bellow answered the racing
flagman’s stop signal.</p>

<p>Two miles back of the halted freights there was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>a disused saw-mill spur, not over a hundred feet
long, to be sure, but it would serve. Maxwell’s
decision was made instantly.</p>

<p>“Back up, both of you, until we can get in on
Crawford’s spur,” he ordered; and as the conductor
started to run to the rear; “Don’t waste
time doing that! Whistle for ’em, you blockhead!”
and he made impatient motions as of an
engineer pulling the whistle-lever.</p>

<p>The first-section engineer, leaning from his cab
window, heard, saw, and understood. Three shrieks
of his whistle were answered by three of the hoarse
bellows from the rear, and the two long freights
began to pound heavily in the reverse motion up
the grade.</p>

<p>“Push ’em, Bascom!” shouted Maxwell, as his
own engine crept up after the retreating first section.
“We’ll go in at Crawford’s and let ’em by.”</p>

<p>The two miles to the passing point, worried out
slowly at the pace set by the laboring freights,
seemed to stretch themselves out into ten.
Sprague was looking at his watch.</p>

<p>“Sixteen miles yet, you say, and we have an
hour and twenty minutes in which to make them.
That looks as if we were still margined well enough
to pull through.”</p>

<p>“I guess so,” said Maxwell. The laboring
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>freights were at last backing around the curve
from which the saw-mill spur branched off, and
again the red-headed fireman was on hand with
his switch-key. Luckily the unused lock did not
refuse to work, and presently the light rails of the
abandoned spur were buckling and bending
ominously under the Nine-fifteen, as Bascom
trundled the wild train out upon them.</p>

<p>Almost immediately the whistles screamed
again, and the two freights slid away down the
grade. “’Right!” yelled the red-headed one,
shifting the rusty switch again; and once more
the race was resumed.</p>

<p>When the Nophi smelter stacks came in sight
in the vista opened up by the flying swing around
the mountain of approach, four watches were out.</p>

<p>“We’re nearly an hour to the good yet,” cried
Benson.</p>

<p>“Yes; and we ain’t there yet,” said Starbuck,
who seemed to have acquired a pessimistic slant.</p>

<p>Maxwell swung far out as they were rounding
the great curve and got a clear view of the small
smelter-town yard. Straightening up, he pulled
the whistle cord to attract Bascom’s attention,
and then leaned out and made the necessary hand-signal
to run through the small town without
stopping.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span></p>

<p>In some inexplicable way the signal, or rather
the giving and receiving of it, proved fatal. Bascom
looked back to nod his understanding, and
when he faced about again he saw, too late, that
a box-car, set out by one of the lately passing
freights on the smelter-loading track, had “drifted”
down the siding to a point at which it would not
clear the main line. There was a ripping crash, a
roar of steam escaping through a broken cylinder,
and the race, so far as Engine Nine-fifteen was
concerned, was over.</p>

<p>When the four passengers had picked themselves
up out of the heap into which the sudden stop had
piled them, they went forward to see what was to
be done. There was nothing to be done locomotive-wise;
but there was still plenty of time, even if the
six remaining miles should have to be covered by
a picked-up team borrowed from the smelter folk.</p>

<p>But the team expedient proved unnecessary.
At the Nophi station they found a section gang at
work, with a hand-car available; and on the “pump
special” they made their entry, some thirty minutes
past five, into the Grafton Brothers’ camp at
the eastern tunnel approach.</p>

<p>Stribling, a handsome young fellow with a frank,
open face and honest eyes, was on hand to meet
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span></p>

<p>“By Jove, Mr. Maxwell!” he said, with what
was apparently a most palpable relieving of anxious
strain, “I was afraid you weren’t coming, and
I’d just about made up my mind to ’phone over
to Lopez to tell Canby and the rest of them that
we’d postpone. I’ve got my record to make yet,
most of it, and I couldn’t afford to turn that power
on and start an engine through until after you and
Benson have gone over the completed installation
with me.”</p>

<p>“Well,” Maxwell rejoined, “that’s what we’re
here to do. You know Starbuck, my brother-in-law?
I thought so. Now shake hands with my
friend Sprague, of the Department of Agriculture,
and we’ll go through with you.”</p>

<p>Starbuck was watching Stribling’s face when
the young electrical engineer shook hands with
the big man from Washington. There was a
query in the younger man’s eyes, and Starbuck
saw it. Also, he marked the half-second of hesitation
which came between the introduction
and its acknowledgment. But a moment later
they were all on their way to the black-mouthed
tunnel, Stribling walking ahead with the superintendent
and Sprague, and Starbuck following with
Benson.</p>

<p>For convenience in his work Stribling had set
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>up a small steam-driven dynamo at his camp and
had strung the tunnel with incandescents, hence
there was plenty of light in the long bore for the
examination of the power wiring. When they
plunged underground the construction man was
still walking ahead with Maxwell and Sprague,
explaining, for the benefit of the superintendent’s
guest, the design of the catenary brackets and the
double set of insulators.</p>

<p>“I’m betting on every detail in the mile and a
quarter,” the young engineer was saying, as the
two laggards closed up. “It’s my first big job, as
Mr. Maxwell knows”&mdash;this also for the guest&mdash;“and
I’ve simply got to make good on it. I could
have had that waiting motor-engine out there
pulling trains through the mountain this morning,
but I made up my mind that we wouldn’t turn a
wheel until Mr. Maxwell had seen everything for
himself.”</p>

<p>“That’s business,” said Sprague, encouragingly.
“Old Davy Crockett’s maxim, eh? ‘Be sure
you’re right, and then go ahead.’ But let me tell
you, Mr. Stribling: Mr. Maxwell will look wise
and say, ‘Yes, yes,’ but he’ll have to take your
word for it, after all. What we average people
don’t know about modern electrical installations
would fill a&mdash;” he looked around as if in search of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>a measure of capacity&mdash;“would fill a tank as big
as that one across the track&mdash;the one you’ve
dipped your wires into over there in that side
cave.”</p>

<p>“The oil-switch, you mean? Yes, that is a
little safety wrinkle we’re putting in wherever
there’s a chance of an accident breaking down the
power wires. I’ll explain it as we come back.”</p>

<p>When the young engineer led the way onward
again a glance to the rear would have shown him
that only three of the four were at his heels.
Starbuck had seen his chance, and in a quick
withdrawal he dodged into the side cavern housing
the oil-switch. Two of the empty dynamite
boxes enabled him to breast the top of the tall
iron tank. What he saw was a little puzzling.
Oil-switch tanks are usually left open to the air,
but this one was fitted with a galvanized-iron cover
made in the form of a shallow pan with double
sides spaced about six inches apart. The inner
compartment of the pan was half-filled with a
transparent oily liquid, and the outer annular
space around it was closely packed with chopped
ice. Hastily breaking the seals of the package he
had been carrying under his coat, he dumped the
contents into the central receptacle and fled
without waiting to prove Sprague’s assertion that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>nothing alarming would happen. When he rejoined
the inspection party Sprague was still holding
Stribling in talk, and the young mine owner
made sure it was done to cover his own momentary
absence.</p>

<p>The remainder of the trip through the tunnel
was made without incident, and on the way back
Stribling halted the party at the safety switch
side cavern which, oddly enough, was charged
with a curiously acrid odor that made breathing
in it chokingly difficult. Coughing and gasping,
Stribling explained the mechanism briefly. An
electro-magnet, energized by the power current
itself, held the switch in contact. If the current
should be interrupted, as in the case of a breakage
due to a wreck, the switch would be thrown and all
the tunnel wires rendered instantly harmless.</p>

<p>“And these boxes are what your machinery came
in?” said Sprague, pointing to a litter of small dust-covered
packing-cases scattered about the tank.</p>

<p>“Oh, no; those are dynamite boxes,” was the
hoarse reply. “They are empty&mdash;at least, Mr.
Benson says they are, and he ought to know, since
they are some of his leavings.” And then:
“Suppose we move on. The air is frightfully bad
in here. The engineer must have stopped the
ventilating fans.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span></p>

<p>Sprague had picked up a rusty bolt left by the
timber-framers.</p>

<p>“You’ve got a good solid oil-tank here,” he said,
hammering lustily on the iron with the bolt.</p>

<p>Starbuck was watching Stribling, and he would
have sworn that the young engineer’s jump took
him two feet clear into the air.</p>

<p>“Great Scott! Don’t do that, Mr. Sprague!”
he cried. “You might break some of the&mdash;some
of the adjustments, you know!”</p>

<p>Sprague’s mellow laugh echoed hollowly in the
timbered cavern.</p>

<p>“If they’re that delicate, perhaps we’d better
take your suggestion and move on,” he said. “I
guess we’ve seen enough, anyway, eh, Maxwell?”</p>

<p>The superintendent acquiesced and the tunnel-threading
was resumed to the portal, and beyond
to the little shack where Stribling had his office.
Here the young man became the hospitable host.</p>

<p>“Sit down, gentlemen, and I’ll call Canby at
the power plant and ask him if he is all ready to
‘cut in.’ If he says yes, you can take the ’phone
and give the order, Mr. Maxwell. It’s your railroad.”</p>

<p>The four disposed themselves as they pleased
in the cramped little office fronting the tunnel.
Sprague took his stand at the single window to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>stare absently at the black hole in the mountain
side&mdash;an unrelieved spot of gloom now that the
incandescents had been turned off. Starbuck
chose a corner, and did not take his eyes from
Stribling, who was sitting at his desk with Maxwell
opposite.</p>

<p>With the receiver at his ear the young engineer
exchanged a few words with the company’s electrician
at the power-house three miles away. Then
he pushed the ’phone across the desk to Maxwell.</p>

<p>“Canby says he’s ready,” he announced, in a
voice that was strangely sharp and tremulous.
“Give him the word, and then watch this volt-meter
on the wall behind me. It will tell you when
the current comes on.”</p>

<p>Maxwell hesitated for a single instant and looked
across at Sprague. But the expert’s back was
turned and he was still staring fixedly at the distant
tunnel mouth. The superintendent took the
receiver and spoke crisply.</p>

<p>“This is Maxwell: if you’re ready, turn on the
power.”</p>

<p>At the word, Sprague faced about quickly and
fixed his gaze upon Stribling. The young man
had turned aside in his chair and his face was
ghastly. Benson and Maxwell were watching the
indicator on the wall; but Starbuck was rising
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>noiselessly from his seat on the cot, with one hand
buried in the side-pocket of his coat. For ten
dragging seconds the index finger of the volt-meter
remained motionless. Stribling was twitching
in his chair, and finally he burst out.</p>

<p>“Those dynamite boxes! We ought to have
taken them out! What if they shouldn’t happen
to be empty&mdash;all of them?”</p>

<p>As he spoke, the index of the volt-meter began
to jump like a thing suddenly endowed with life,
and Benson cried out, “There she comes!” Stribling
crouched in his chair as if shrinking from a
blow and covered his face with his hands. Ten
seconds, twenty seconds, ticked themselves off on
the little desk clock at Maxwell’s elbow, and then
Sprague’s voice broke into the tense silence.</p>

<p>“It’s all over, Stribling. You can sit up now
and take your medicine. The end of the world
is still safely in the future.”</p>

<p>The young man whirled in his chair and his
right hand shot toward a half-opened drawer of
the desk. It was Starbuck who interposed.</p>

<p>“Nixie,” he said sharply; “it isn’t time for you
to pass out yet. Keep your hands out of that
drawer, or I’ll put these on,” jingling a pair of
handcuffs before the culprit’s staring eyes.</p>

<p>Stribling leaped from his chair and took one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>long haggard look through the open door at
the tunnel mouth where nothing was happening.
Then he dropped back and became the trapped
animal fighting for life.</p>

<p>“What have you got on me?&mdash;or what is it you
think you’ve got?” he rasped.</p>

<p>It was the man from Washington who replied.</p>

<p>“Don’t make it harder for yourself than you
have to,” he said gently. “We’ve got it all. We
know that you had that train stopped last night
so that you could unload those empty dynamite
boxes&mdash;they are empty, you know&mdash;without discovery.
We also know that this morning you
placed a quantity of nitro-glycerine in that safety switch,
and that you have the wiring rigged to
fire the stuff and destroy the tunnel.”</p>

<p>The young man looked up and his smile showed
his teeth.</p>

<p>“But the current is on and the tunnel isn’t destroyed,”
he interrupted.</p>

<p>“No; you overdid it a little in asking Benson
to help you handle the nitro-glycerine and in letting
him spill it on his clothes; also you skipped a
stitch when you thought that by smuggling those
dynamite boxes in and calling everybody’s attention
to them, you’d put the blame of the explosion
upon Benson and the railroad people. You forgot
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>that all makers of dynamite nowadays stamp
the date on the boxes. The tunnel was completed
two years ago; and the date on one of the boxes,
at least, is January of the present year. You are
down and out, Mr. Stribling, and there is only one
way in which you can dodge the stripes. That is
by telling us who hired you to do this.”</p>

<p>A silence, tense like the silence of the court-room
when the judge pronounces the sentence, fell
upon the group gathered in the little shack-office,
and it lasted for a full minute. At the end of it
Stribling jerked his head up and spoke.</p>

<p>“I’m a man again now, Mr. Sprague, if I haven’t
been for the past two months,” he said steadily.
“I’ll tell you this: you can give me the third degree,
if you want to&mdash;there are enough of you
here to do it&mdash;and after that you can send me to
the pen if you feel like it. But, so help me God,
you’ll never make me welsh on the man for whom
I did this: never, so long as I have the breath to
say no!”</p>

<p>Again the tense silence supervened, and Starbuck
held up the handcuffs tentatively. Sprague
shook his head, and spoke again.</p>

<p>“You’ve considered this resolution well, have
you, Stribling?”</p>

<p>“I have. I owe that man everything I’ve got
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>in this world: education, the chance to hold my
head up with others and, more than that, he once
saved my father from going where you mean to
send me&mdash;over the road. I’ll admit all you have
charged. I did set the trap, and I don’t know yet
why it hasn’t gone off. All I ask is that you’ll
remember that I picked a time when there wouldn’t
be any lives lost.”</p>

<p>“I discovered that last night,” said Sprague
quietly; adding, with a glance for the superintendent’s
brother-in-law, “I guess we’ll have to
turn him over to you, Mr. Starbuck.” Then,
turning once more upon the culprit: “Why did
you find it necessary to cross the power wires with
the telegraph lines early this afternoon, and so to
destroy the instruments on a hundred miles of
railroad, Stribling?”</p>

<p>The young engineer looked up hardily. “It was
necessary. I took care to have Canby and the
railroad electricians all over at the power plant,
and I couldn’t take the chance of leaving them in
communication with head-quarters at Brewster.”</p>

<p>Maxwell, who had sat as a silent listener, shook
his head sadly and got up and went out, followed
by Benson. A little later Sprague, standing at
the window, saw them trying out the electric locomotive
in short runs up and down the tunnel approach.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>Starbuck came out of his corner and
snapped the manacles on Stribling’s wrists, and
the young man made no resistance. Sprague
turned at the click of the handcuffs, standing to
frown down thoughtfully upon the self-confessed
wrecker.</p>

<p>“I was in hopes we were going to get the men
higher up this time; get them so they would stay
got,” he said, half to himself. “But it seems that
a bit of common human gratitude is going to blunder
around and get in the way. Stribling, I’m
honestly sorry for you. I’m afraid we made a
mistake in not letting you get hold of that gun a
few minutes ago.”</p>

<p>The young man with the honest eyes looked up
quickly. “You did, indeed, Mr. Sprague. It’s
the simplest way out of it for me.”</p>

<p>“You are still determined not to do the larger
justice by giving us the information we need?”</p>

<p>The young man raised his manacled hands.</p>

<p>“Think of it a minute,” he pleaded. “You
wouldn’t do it yourself; you know you wouldn’t.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know&mdash;I don’t know; perhaps I
shouldn’t,” admitted the big man thoughtfully.
Then he went on with visible reluctance: “I’m
afraid we shall have to pinch you, and pinch you
hard, my boy. And it’s a shame, when you were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>only a tool in the hands of the men who ought
to do time for this thing. I suppose we shall
be taking the seven o’clock passenger back to
Brewster. Is there anything you’d like to do
before it comes along?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I’d like to write a letter or two.”</p>

<p>“You shall do it, and you shall have privacy.”
And then to Starbuck: “Fix him so that he can.”</p>

<p>Starbuck unlocked the manacle from Stribling’s
right wrist and locked it again around the arm
of the office chair. “Will that give you room
enough?” he asked.</p>

<p>“More than enough,” was the quiet reply. And
when Starbuck had taken the pistol from the half-opened
desk drawer the two who were free went out
and closed the door against any possible intrusion
upon the captive’s privacy.</p>

<p>“I’ll stay round,” Starbuck volunteered, when
they were outside. “You go over and ride the
engine with Mr. Maxwell, if you want to.”</p>

<p>It was half an hour later when the three who had
been trying out the electric locomotive side-tracked
the big machine at the sound of the down
passenger’s whistle signal at the western tunnel
approach, and crossed the tracks to where Starbuck
was standing guard at the reopened door of
the office-shack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span></p>

<p>“Still writing?” asked Sprague of the silent
guard.</p>

<p>“No; for the last ten minutes he’s been sitting
there with his head on the table, just as you see
him. He asked me to open the door a while ago,
so he could see better.”</p>

<p>Moved by a common impulse they entered the
office-room, stepping softly. But the young man
at the desk was far beyond all earthly disturbances.
One letter, addressed to a girl in New
York, lay on the desk, stamped and sealed. Hanging
beside the chair, and ingeniously strung and
weighted so that they could touch nothing, were
the two heavily insulated power wires which he
had somehow managed to disconnect from the
volt-meter switch-board at his back; these and a
freshly burned shrivel on the hand of the arm that
was crooked for a pillow told how it had been done.</p>

<p>“Good God!” Maxwell exclaimed; “we might
have thought of that! Poor fellow! He couldn’t
face it out, after all!”</p>

<p>Starbuck gently released the handcuffs and
slipped them into his pocket. Then he helped
Benson put the body of the man who could not
face it out upon the cot in the corner. The train
was coming, and Benson pushed the others toward
the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span></p>

<p>“Don’t stay here and miss your train,” he said.
“I’ll do what there is to be done. I was going to
stay, anyway.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The evening train was feeling its way down over
the wireless line and was half-way to Brewster
before the three men sitting in the otherwise unoccupied
smoking-compartment of the sleeper
broke the silence which the sudden tragedy had
laid upon them. But at the lighting of his third
cigar Maxwell could contain himself no longer.</p>

<p>“It’s another of your miracles, Calvin,” he said.
“By this time I’m so well used to them that nothing
you do fazes me any more. But I’m sure
Billy will sleep better to-night if you tell him how
you did it.”</p>

<p>The big man grunted softly.</p>

<p>“I think both of you have put the broken bits
of the puzzle together before this,” he returned.
“The motive was the chief thing; what I call the
‘nucleus thought,’ and we had that all ready-made.
We knew that this ‘Big Nine,’ as Ford
names it, was out after your scalp; and as soon as
you told me about the tunnel and the Grafton
Brothers’ contract the probable point of attack
was no longer in doubt. You see, I happen to
know that the Graftons have always been hand-in-glove
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>with your principal competitor&mdash;had installed
all the block signals for it, cutting a fine
melon for themselves in the process, too.”</p>

<p>“Still,” said Maxwell, “it’s a long way from
that to this.”</p>

<p>“It was only taking one step after another, and
Benson gave me three or four of them. The details
of Stribling’s exceedingly simple plot became
very plain after Benson had told us about the
train-stopping, the empty dynamite boxes, the
safety switch&mdash;which could have been just as
easily and effectively placed at either end of the
tunnel as in that hole in the middle of it&mdash;and
finally about the pouring of the sirupy stuff into
the oil-tank. There was a bit of fine work on
Stribling’s part. Benson doubtless knows nitro-glycerine
when he sees it; but under the circumstances
he would be completely disarmed&mdash;as he
was.”</p>

<p>“But how did you know that there would be a
false cover on the tank?” queried Starbuck.</p>

<p>“A bit of pure reasoning. The specific gravity
of glycerine is greater than that of the heaviest of
the earth oils; hence the explosive would sink to
the bottom of the tank and mix with the oil to
some extent. I reasoned that Stribling would not
take the risk of the mixture.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span></p>

<p>“He didn’t,” said the mine owner; “the pan
was there and it was packed in ice.”</p>

<p>“But the laboratory experiment?” put in Maxwell.</p>

<p>“Was a simple test for nitro-glycerine, of course.
You saw it blow up the test-tube, but even then
only one of you,&mdash;Mr. Starbuck here,&mdash;suspected
the truth. You did, didn’t you, Mr. Starbuck?”</p>

<p>“I had a guess comin’,” said the young mine
owner quietly; adding: “That was why I took
the trouble to hunt me up a pair of handcuffs
when I went to get the train-orders.”</p>

<p>“But if there was nitro-glycerine in that tank,
why didn’t it go off when the current was turned
on?” queried Maxwell.</p>

<p>“For the very simple reason that Mr. Starbuck,
at my direction, dumped a large dose of neutralizing
chemical into it as we passed the tank on our
way through the tunnel, and so saponified it.
That was why I had the courage to hammer on
the tank with my bolt, and why Stribling, not
dreaming that his touchy explosive’s teeth had
been drawn, nearly had a fit.”</p>

<p>“One other thing,” Maxwell put in. “You
asked Stribling why he burned the telegraph
wires out; how did you know they had been burned
out?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span></p>

<p>Sprague chuckled good-naturedly.</p>

<p>“I knew that at Little Butte; you might have
known it if you hadn’t been so excited as to forget
that you had a nose. That office, as well as the
next one,&mdash;I’ve forgotten its name,&mdash;fairly reeked
with the smell of burnt rubber and insulation, and
I said to myself that there were only two torches
in these mountains that could heat things hot
enough to burn the instruments: namely, lightning
and the high-voltage current from your plant
in Lopez Canyon.”</p>

<p>Again a silence, broken only by the train clamor,
settled down upon the three in the Pullman
smoking-room. After a time Maxwell drew a
long breath and said:</p>

<p>“It was a narrow squeak; a horribly narrow
squeak, Calvin. We have a good deal to say nowadays
about the lawlessness of the mob and the
individual; but big money doesn’t seem to know
that there are any such things as justice and equity
and a square deal.”</p>

<p>Sprague sat up and methodically relighted his
cigar.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know about that,” he demurred.
“You can’t say that all big money is lawless. Of
course, there are buccaneers in every chapter of
the world’s history, and we have ours, neatly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>labelled with the dollar-mark instead of the skull
and cross-bones. Good big money is an undoubted
blessing; it is only bad big money that is a curse.”</p>

<p>Maxwell’s smile was mirthless.</p>

<p>“When a man puts a gun in your face and holds
you up, it isn’t very consoling to remember that
there are a good many other men in the world who
wouldn’t treat you that way,” he commented.
And then: “I hope we’ve seen the last of this fight
in the dark with that stock-jobbing gang in New
York.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t,” Sprague declared definitely.
“They’ll come back at you, and keep on coming
back, until you get a fair grand-jury underhold on
the men at the top. I counted confidently upon
being able to give you that underhold to-day. I
thought we had Stribling where he would be obliged
to turn state’s evidence. It was our misfortune
that he happened to be too good a man; that he
was only the tool of a villain and not a villain himself.
They’ll hit you again, Maxwell, and go
on hitting you until you can strike back hard
enough to put some of the men higher up in the
prisoner’s dock.”</p>

<p>This might have stood for the final word; but
the true finality was reached a couple of hours
later when the superintendent and the Government
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>expert were smoking their bedtime pipes in
the Topaz lobby.</p>

<p>“We haven’t fully grasped the real pity of this
thing yet, Dick,” said Sprague, at the end of the
ends. “It is this: that greed, the infernal lust of
money that has laid hold upon our day and generation,
can take so fine a thing as that poor boy’s
gratitude, transform it into criminality, and make
him pay the price with his life. Isn’t that enough
to make your blood run cold? Let’s turn in and
forget it if we can. Good-night. I’m going to
bed.”</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE wreck at Lobo Cut, half-way between
Angels and the upper portal of Timanyoni
Canyon, was a pretty bad one. Train Six, known
in the advertising folders as “The Fast Mail,”
had collided in the early-morning darkness with
the first section of a westbound freight which,
though it was an hour and fifty minutes off its
schedule time, had run past Angels without heeding
the “stop for orders” signal plainly displayed.</p>

<p>Ten minutes after the crash, the second section
of the freight had shot around the hill curve to
hurl itself, a six-thousand-ton, steel-pointed projectile,
into the rear end of the first section, and
the disaster was complete. Somewhere under the
smoking mountain of wreckage marking the spot
where the Mail and first-section locomotives had
locked themselves together, reared, and fallen
over into the ditch, two firemen and an engineer
were buried. Out of one of the crushed mail-cars
two postal clerks were taken; one of them to
die a few minutes after his rescue, and the other
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>bruised and broken, with an arm and a leg dangling,
as he was carried out to safety.</p>

<p>At the other point of impact there had been no
loss of life, though the material damage was almost
as great. The engine of the second section
had split its way sheer through the first-section
caboose&mdash;which, in the nature of things, had no
one in it to be killed&mdash;and through two of the three
merchandise-cars next in its plunging path. With
a mixed chaos of groceries, farming implements,
and splintered timbers for its monument, the big
mogul had burrowed into the soft side bank of the
cutting as if in some blind attempt to bury itself
out of sight of the havoc it had wrought.</p>

<p>On the Thursday morning of this, the worst of a
series of accidents thickly bestudding that fateful
month of August, Maxwell, the general superintendent,
chanced to be two hundred miles away
to the eastward. His service-car was in the Copah
yards, and he was asleep in it when the night watchman
came down from the despatcher’s office to
rouse him with the bad news.</p>

<p>What could be done at such long range was done
instantly and with good generalship. The wires
were working with Brewster, the division head-quarters
in Timanyoni Park. With his own hand
Maxwell sent the orders to Connolly, the despatcher,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>to Fordyce, the trainmaster, and to Bascom,
the master mechanic. A relief train was to
be made up with all haste to take the doctors to
the wreck, and to convey the passengers of Number
Six back to Brewster. Following the relief
train, but giving it precedence, should go the
wrecking-train. The superintendent even went
so far as to specify the equipment which should
be taken: the heavier of the two wrecking-cranes,
a car-load of rails for temporary tracking, and two
or three water-cars for the extinguishing of the
fire.</p>

<p>These things done, and the arrangements made
to start his own special immediately for the scene
of disaster, the superintendent had the fine courage,
in the face of this last and most unnerving
of many disheartenments, to return to his car and
to go back to bed. He had been up very late in
conference with his president, Ford, and he knew
that the demands awaiting him at the end of the
five-hour run to Lobo Cut would call for all the
reserves of strength and energy he could hope to
store up during the distance-covering interval.</p>

<p>Much good work had already been accomplished
when Maxwell’s special, feeling its way past the
four long freights and the midnight passenger, all
held up at Angels, came upon the scene of destruction
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>among the foot-hills at an early hour in the
forenoon. The relief train had come and gone,
bearing away the unhurt, the injured, and the dead.
A temporary working-track had been laid through
the cut, and the mighty one-hundred-and-fifty-ton
steam crane, its movements directed by a big,
rather flashily dressed man with an accurately
creased brown hat pulled down over his brows,
was reaching its steel finger here and there in the
débris and plucking the derelict freight-cars out
of the way.</p>

<p>Up at the other end Fordyce, the trainmaster,
was working with another crew, using a mammoth
block-and-tackle, with a detached locomotive
for its pulling power. When Maxwell came
on the ground, Fordyce, a gnarled little man
with a twist in his jaw and a temper like the sparks
from an emery wheel, was alternately cajoling
and cursing his men in a praiseworthy attempt to
make his block-and-tackle outheave the master
mechanic’s powerful crane.</p>

<p>“Yank ’em&mdash;yank ’em, men! Get that rail
under there and heave! Wig it&mdash;<i>wig it</i>! Now
get that grab-hook in here&mdash;lively! Don’t let
them fellows at the other end snake two to our
ONE!”</p>

<p>Maxwell stopped to exchange a word or two
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>with the sweating trainmaster and then passed
on down the wreck-strewn line. At the master
mechanic’s end of things he came upon Benson,
chief of construction, who had accompanied the
wrecking-train from Brewster only because he had
happened to be on the way to Angels and saw no
other probable means of reaching his destination.</p>

<p>“Pretty bad medicine&mdash;the worst of the lot,”
commented the young chief of construction, when,
tramping soberly, they came to the place where the
two great locomotives, locked in their death grapple,
were nuzzling the clay bank of the cutting.</p>

<p>Maxwell’s teeth came together with a savage
little click.</p>

<p>“A few weeks ago, Jack, we were scared stiff for
fear the ‘Big Nine’ crowd of stock-jobbers would
succeed in doing something to put us on the panic-slide.
Now we are doing it ourselves, just about
as fast as we can. Is it true that there were four
killed?”</p>

<p>“Yes; both firemen, and Bamberg, the engineer
of the freight. The other man was a postal
clerk; and his mate had an arm and a leg broken.”</p>

<p>“Many injuries?”</p>

<p>“Astonishingly few, when there was such a good
chance for a general massacre. Both men on the
second section engine jumped, and both were hurt,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>though not badly. There was nobody in the split
caboose when it was hit. On the Mail, Cargill,
who was running, got off with a pretty bad scalp
wound. An express messenger had his foot
jammed; and the train baggageman had a lot of
trunks shaken down on him. In the coaches there
were a few people thrown out of their seats and
hurt by the sudden stop; but in the sleepers there
were a good many who slept straight through it,
incredible as that may sound.”</p>

<p>“I know,” said Maxwell; “I’ve seen that happen
more than once, when the Pullmans stayed
on the rails.” Then, with a slight backward nod
of his head he changed the subject abruptly.
“Bascom&mdash;has he been handling it all right?”</p>

<p>“He’s a dandy!” said Benson. “Personally,
I’d about as soon associate with any one of a
dozen Copah tin-horns that I could name as to
foregather with Mr. Judson Bascom. But he’s
onto his job, all right. He laid this temporary
track himself; I haven’t butted in at all, either
here or at Fordyce’s end.”</p>

<p>“How did you happen to get here? I thought
you were up Red Butte way,” said the superintendent.</p>

<p>“I was; but I came down to Brewster on Six last
night, meaning to go through to Angels. While
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>we were changing engines I ran upstairs to get
some maps and papers out of my office, and took
too long about it; the train got away from me and
I chased out with the wreck-wagons. That’s how
near I came to being mixed up in this thing myself.”</p>

<p>“And you want to go on to Angels now?”</p>

<p>“Yes; when I get a chance. Those irrigation
people in Mesquite Valley are howling to have an
unloading spur built up from the old copper-mine
track, and I thought I’d go and look the ground
over.”</p>

<p>The superintendent’s frown was expressive of
impatient dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>“That Mesquite project is another of the grafts
that are continually giving this country a black
eye, Jack. It’s ‘bunk,’ pure and simple. Everybody
who has ever been in the Mesquite knows that
you couldn’t raise little white beans in that disintegrated
sandstone!”</p>

<p>“It’ll do for an excuse to rake in a few hundred
thousand Eastern shekels,” Benson remarked.
“There will be plenty of ‘come-ons’ to buy the
land when the dam is built.”</p>

<p>Bascom’s great crane was poising a crushed and
mangled box-car in air, and when the crooking
steel finger swung its burden aside and dropped it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>with a crash out of the way, Maxwell turned upon
his heel.</p>

<p>“I have my car here, and I’m going back to
Angels to do some wiring,” he said. “Come along,
if you want to see those irrigation people. But I’ll
tell you right now, I won’t approve any recommendation
for more track-laying for them.”</p>

<p>They had walked possibly half the length of the
long blockade when a noisy automobile, dust-covered
and filled with men, drew up on the mesa
flat above the wreck. Benson looked up with a
scowl.</p>

<p>“There’s another gang of those newspaper
ghouls!” he commented, as two of the three men
in the tonneau got out and began to unlimber
their cameras and tripods. “It’s no picnic to
drive a car from Brewster over the range, to say
nothing of the danger; and this is the second squad
since daylight. There have been enough pictures
taken of this wreck to fill all the newspapers between
New York and San Francisco for a week!”</p>

<p>Maxwell’s smile was a mere teeth-baring.</p>

<p>“Yes; we’re getting the advertising all right,”
he said. “We’ve been getting it for a month or
more.” Then, as they tramped on out of the
wreck raffle and headed for the waiting office-car:
“I had a talk with Ford last night; that is what
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>took me to Copah. We’re in bad, Benson. Ford
says they’ve taken to calling us ‘the sick railroad’
on the Stock Exchange, and our securities are
simply going to the puppies. Another month like
this one we’ve just stumbled through will either
wipe us from the map or clean us up definitely
and put us into the hands of a receiver.”</p>

<p>“Does Ford say that?” gasped the young chief
engineer.</p>

<p>“He said a good bit more than that. He still
insists that these troubles of ours are helped along
from the outside; that they are in reality just so
many moves in the game that a certain Wall
Street pool is playing to get control of our road.
I tried to show him how impossible it was; how
the entire slump in discipline which causes all the
trouble is merely one of those crazy epidemics that
now and then sweep over the length of the best-managed
railroads on earth.”</p>

<p>“And he wouldn’t believe it?” queried Benson.</p>

<p>“No; the last thing he said to me as his train
was pulling out proved that he didn’t. He intimated
that there wasn’t any ‘act-of-God’ verdict
to be brought in, in our case, and told me to
go back to Brewster and dig until I found the real
cause.”</p>

<p>By this time they had reached the service-car
special, and Maxwell passed the word to his engineer
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>to back up the line to Angels. When the
wreck and the wreckers had vanished beyond the
hill curves, Benson filled his short pipe and at the
lighting of it asked another question.</p>

<p>“I’ve been wondering if we couldn’t get a little
expert help on this thing, Maxwell. Have you
tried to interest Mr. Sprague in this discipline
business?”</p>

<p>The superintendent shook his head.</p>

<p>“Sprague isn’t going around doing odd jobs in
psychology for anybody and everybody,” he deprecated.
“He is a Government chemist, and he
is out here on the Government’s business. Besides,
it isn’t a case for a detective; even for the
best amateur detective in the bunch&mdash;which is
easily what Sprague might claim to be, you’d say.
You see, there isn’t anything special to detect.
What we need is a doctor; not a plain-clothes
man.”</p>

<p>Benson’s left eye closed itself slowly in qualified
dissent.</p>

<p>“What does Mr. Sprague himself have to say
about it?” he queried.</p>

<p>“He hasn’t said anything. In fact, I haven’t
seen him for over two weeks. He’s been out with
Billy Starbuck, gathering soil specimens; they are
still out somewhere, I don’t know just where.”</p>

<p>Neither of the two men riding the rear platform
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>of the backing service-car spoke again until the
car stopped with a jerk at the edge-of-the-desert
station with the celestial name, which had once
been the head-quarters of the original Red Butte
Western Railroad. Then Benson summed up the
situation in a couple of terse sentences.</p>

<p>“If we don’t do something, and do it quick,
there is a bunch of us so-called railroad bosses on
this high line who may as well pack our duffle-bags
and fade away into the landscape. Three
wrecks within a week; and this last one will cost a
hundred thousand cold iron dollars before we’re
through with the lawyers; I’ll be hanged if I
wouldn’t call in the doctor&mdash;some doctor&mdash;any
doctor, Maxwell. That’s my ante. So long; see
you a little later about this Mesquite business,
if you’re still here.” And he put a leg over the
platform railing and went away.</p>

<p>Three minutes later, when the superintendent
had crossed the station platform and was on his
way around to the door opening into the operator’s
office, two men mounted upon wiry range horses
rode down the single remaining street of the dead-alive
former railroad town, pointing for the station.</p>

<p>One of them, a good-looking youngish man with
a preternaturally grave face and the shrewd
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>thoughtful eyes that tell of days and nights spent
afield and alone with the desert immensities, was
the superintendent’s brother-in-law by courtesy.
The other, a gigantic athlete of a man, whose
weight fairly bowed the back of the stout horse
he rode, was Mr. Calvin Sprague.</p>

<p>Maxwell paused when he saw and recognized the
two horsemen. But when they came up, the
weight of the recent disaster made his greeting a
rather dismal attempt at friendly jocularity.</p>

<p>“Well, well!” he said, gripping hands with the
athlete; “Billy certainly had it in for you this
time! Rode you over the range, did he? I’ll bet
you’ll never have the nerve to look a horse in the
face again, after this. Where on top of earth have
you two been keeping yourselves for the last fortnight?”</p>

<p>“Oh, just sashayin’ round on the edges,”
drawled Starbuck, replying for both; “gettin’ acquainted
with the luminous landscape, and chewin’
off chunks of the scenery, and layin’ awake nights
to soak up some of the good old ozone.”</p>

<p>“Ozone!” chuckled the big man; “I’m jammed
gullet-full of it, Dick, and I have a hunch that it’s
going to settle somewhere below the waist line and
make me bow-legged for life. King David said
that a horse is a vain thing for safety, but I can go
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>him one better and say that it’s the vainest possible
thing for just plain, ordinary, every-day comfort.
I’m a living parenthesis-mark&mdash;or a pair of
’em, if you like that better.” Then without warning
and almost without a break: “Where is the
wreck, this time?”</p>

<p>Maxwell’s frown was a little brow-wrinkling of
curious perplexity.</p>

<p>“You’ve just ridden down from the hills, haven’t
you? How do you know there is a wreck?”</p>

<p>“That’s too easy,” laughed the expert, waving
a Samsonic arm toward the five side-tracked trains
held up in the Angels yard. “If you didn’t have
your track cluttered up somewhere, those trains
wouldn’t be hanging up here, I’m sure. Is it a
bad one?&mdash;but you needn’t answer that; I can see
at least one dead man in your eyes.”</p>

<p>“There are four of them,” said the superintendent
soberly, “and some others desperately hurt.
We’re in a bad way, Sprague. This is the third
smash within a week.”</p>

<p>Sprague dismounted stiffly and secured his
saddle-bags containing the soil specimens gathered
at the price of so much discomfort.</p>

<p>“Starbuck,” he said whimsically, “I’m willing
to pay the price of a hundred-dollar guinea-pig,
if necessary, to have this razor-back mustang
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>shipped home in a palace stock-car to his stable
in Brewster. Mr. Maxwell’s office-car is good
enough for me from this on.”</p>

<p>Starbuck smiled grimly and took the abandoned
horse in charge. “I’ll take care of the bronc’,” he
agreed; and the big man limped around the station
to board the service-car while Maxwell went into
the office to do his telegraphing.</p>

<p>When the superintendent returned half an hour
later he found his self-invited guest lounging luxuriously
in the easiest of the big wicker chairs in the
open compartment of the car, smoking the fattest
of black cigars and reading a two-days-old Denver
paper.</p>

<p>“This is something like,” he said. “I was never
cut out for a pioneer, Richard; Starbuck has
proved that to my entire satisfaction in these last
two weeks. But that’s enough of me and my
knockings. Sit down and tell me your troubles.
I see the papers are making space-fillers out of
your railroad to beat the band. Are you ready to
come around to my point of view yet?”</p>

<p>Maxwell sat down like a man who was both worried
and wearied.</p>

<p>“The Lord knows, I wish I could come around
to your point of view, Calvin. If I could see any
possibility of charging these things to outside
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>influences.... But there isn’t any. The trouble
is purely local and internal&mdash;and as unaccountable
as the breaking out of an epidemic when the strictest
kind of quarantine has been maintained.”</p>

<p>Sprague smiled incredulously.</p>

<p>“There never was a case of typhoid yet without
its germ to account for it, Dick,” he asserted dogmatically.</p>

<p>“I know; but that theory doesn’t hold good in
the psychological field. We’ve got a good set of
men, Sprague. To a degree which you don’t often
find in modern railroad consolidations, we’ve had
that precious thing called <i>esprit de corps</i>. We’ve
never had any labor troubles since Lidgerwood’s
time, and there are no grievances in the air to account
for the present let-down. Yet the let-down
is with us. Almost every day some man who has
hitherto proved trustworthy falls down on his job,
and there you are.”</p>

<p>“You’ve tried all the usual remedies, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“I should say I had! I’ve stormed and cursed
and pleaded and reasoned until I’m worn out! If
I fire a bunch of them, I have to hire a new bunch,
and inside of a week the new men have caught the
disease for themselves. One bad wreck will make
a hundred trainmen uncertain and jumpy, and a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>second one will turn half of the hundred into irresponsible
lunatics. You’d have to mix and mingle
with the force as I do to understand the condition
things have gotten into. It’s horrible, Calvin.
It is like the black blight that you have seen spread
through a well-kept orchard.”</p>

<p>“There is a cause,” said the expert, settling
himself solidly in his chair. “I tell you, Dick,
there’s a germ in the air, and that second mentality
of mine that you are so fond of poking fun at
tells me that in the case of your railroad orchard
the germ has been deliberately planted. You say
it’s impossible: I’ve a good notion to let the soil-testing
rest for a few minutes and show you.”</p>

<p>“If I thought there was the least chance in the
world that you could show me&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Is that a challenge? By Jove! I’ll take you.
When can you get me back to Brewster?”</p>

<p>“As soon as the track is cleared. We ought to
be able to get through by noon.”</p>

<p>The expert got up, shook the riding kinks out
of his legs, and threw the newspaper aside.</p>

<p>“I’m going out to walk around for a bit, and
after a while I’ll ask you to take me down to
this wreck,” he said; and Maxwell, who had a
deskful of work awaiting him, nodded.</p>

<p>“Say, in an hour?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span></p>

<p>“An hour will do; I’ll show up within that
time.”</p>

<p>Later, the superintendent, wading through the
files of business correspondence which always accompanied
him in his goings to and fro on the line,
had window glimpses of Sprague strolling up and
down beside the waiting trains in the yard or standing
to chat with some member of the loafing crews.</p>

<p>The glimpses were provocative of good-natured
incredulity on the part of the desk-worker. Thrice
during the summer of warfare Sprague had been
able to step into the breach, each time with signal
success. But in each of the three former instances
there had been tangible causes with which to grapple;
flesh-and-blood criminals to be ferreted out
and apprehended. Maxwell, glancing out of the
window again, shook his head despondently.
What could the keenest intelligence avail in the
case of an entire railroad suffering from an acute
attack of nervous disintegration and recklessness?
Nothing, the superintendent decided; there was
nothing for it but to settle down upon a grim
determination to outlive and worry through the
period of disaster; and he was still grinding away
at his desk with that thought in the back part of
his mind when Sprague came in and announced
his willingness to be taken on to the wreck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span></p>

<p>Maxwell gave the necessary order, and in due
time the one-car special had repassed the few miles
intervening between Angels and Lobo Cut, to
come to a stand on the curve of hazard. Sprague
was lighting a fresh cigar preparatory to a plunge
into the track-clearing activities, and Maxwell
looked up from his work.</p>

<p>“Want me to get off with you?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No; it’s the very thing I don’t want,” declared
the expert briefly; and therewith he went
out to drop from the car-step and to take the
plunge alone.</p>

<p>In the two hours which had elapsed since the
departure of the superintendent’s car the track-clearers
at both ends of the wreck had made
astonishingly good progress. Step by step the
master mechanic had worked his big crane up the
line, tossing the derelicts aside or righting them
upon the rails, as their condition warranted; and
farther along Fordyce, with his huge tackle and its
pulling locomotive, had been equally enthusiastic.</p>

<p>It was Sprague’s boast that his methods of investigation,
in the field of his hobby, as in all
others, were purely scientific; and he insisted
that the true scientist and the most successful is
the one who can best qualify as a shrewd and
wholly impartial observer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span></p>

<p>Where another man might have asked questions,
he stood aside and looked on and listened. In the
fierce toil of track-clearing no one seemed to pay
any attention to him, and the picture which presented
itself was a life-sketch of the railroad force
<i>in petto</i> and in the raw. The big onlooker took
his time and made his mental jottings thoughtfully,
strolling from one group to another and
lingering longest near the hot boiler-cab of the
great crane where a wizened human automaton
in dirty overalls and jumper jerked the levers
and spun the wheels of the hoist in obedience to
the signals given by the flashily dressed master
mechanic.</p>

<p>It wanted less than a quarter of an hour of noon
when the final obstruction was heaved aside, and
the track gang, which had been following the
wreckers, trued and spiked the distorted rails of
the main line into place. Sprague closed his
mental note-book and went back to join Maxwell.</p>

<p>In the office-car the porter-cook had laid the
table for the mid-day meal; and the superintendent
and his guest ate it in transit, the office-car
special being the first of the halted trains to pass
westward over the newly cleared line.</p>

<p>“Well?” said Maxwell interrogatively, when the
meal had progressed to the meat and vegetables
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>without comment on the part of the one who had
lifted the challenge.</p>

<p>“You’ve got the disease, all right; it’s with you,
and in the epidemic form, too. Its expression
came out emphatically every now and then in
that track-clearing hustle. One little snappy,
snarly fellow lying under a box-car to make the
hoisting-hitch voiced it precisely when his mate
yelled at him to come out, that the hitch might
slip. He yapped back, ‘Who the hell and blinkety-blank
blankation cares!’ That’s one form your
disease is taking, and you’d say it would account
for a good many of the smashes.”</p>

<p>“Well?” queried the superintendent again.
“You didn’t stop at that?”</p>

<p>“No; I made a few other preliminary observations
which may or may not prove up. Give me
a little time; and when we get back to Brewster,
detail that ex-cowboy ‘relief operator’ of yours,
Tarbell, to run errands for me. If I can’t show you
good, tangible results within the next forty-eight
hours or so, you may discharge me and hire a
Pinkerton.”</p>

<p>“You’ll fail,” said Maxwell gloomily. “I’ve
been through a sickness of this kind before.
There’s no cure for it. It has simply got to run
its course and wear itself out.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span></p>

<p>“That’s what they used to say about cholera
and the plague and yellow-fever, and all those
things,” laughed the man from Washington; but
he did not go any farther into the matter of
theories.</p>

<p>The run of the special train to Brewster was
made without incident, and from the station
Sprague went directly across to his hotel.</p>

<p>“I’m going over to clean up,” he announced.
“By and by, when you get around to it, send Tarbell
over and tell him to wait in the lobby for me.”</p>

<p>It was possibly an hour later when the young
man who resembled William Starbuck sufficiently
to pass for the mine owner’s younger brother, got
out of his chair in the quietest corner of the Hotel
Topaz lobby and crossed to the elevators to meet
the Government chemist.</p>

<p>“How are you, Archer?” was the renovated soil-gatherer’s
greeting. And then, as he led the way
back to the quiet corner from which the young
man had been keeping his watch upon the elevators:
“We’re up against it good and hard, this
time, young man. Your boss has stumped us to
prove a thing which he says can’t be proved. Sit
down and let’s see if we can’t start the thin edge of
a wedge. I’ll do the hammering and let you hold
the wedge, and you can squeal if I strike off and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>hit you. How long has this case of bad railroading,
which is smashing things right and left, been
going on?”</p>

<p>The young fellow who was on the railroad pay-rolls
as a “relief operator” took time to consider.</p>

<p>“A month or better.”</p>

<p>“How did it begin?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. One way ’r another, the boys’ve
just seemed to be gettin’ sort o’ careless and
losin’ their grip. After two or three wrecks had
happened, it was all off. Half o’ the men’ve
taken to runnin’ on their nerve, and the other half
act like they don’t care a durn.”</p>

<p>“Is it only in the train service?”</p>

<p>“Lord, no; it’s mighty near everywhere. It’s
sort of a dry rot; cars go without repairin’, engines
burn out, and twice within the last week the roundhouse
has caught fire. You’d think every man on
the road had just turned loose all holts and didn’t
give a cuss whether he ever got ’em again or not.”</p>

<p>“What do the men themselves say about it?”</p>

<p>“There’s a heap o’ kickin’ and knockin’. Some
say it’s Mr. Maxwell. When he gets good and
mad and fires a bunch of ’em, they raise a rookus
about it; and when he lets the next bunch down
easy, they kick the other way.”</p>

<p>Sprague sat back in the big leather-upholstered
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>lobby chair and for a time seemed to be absorbed
in a study of the rather over-massive beam arrangement
of the ceiling. Suddenly he turned
to ask: “How much of a prohibition country is
this, Archer?”</p>

<p>Tarbell laughed.</p>

<p>“I reckon you don’t need to ask that, with three
saloons in every block in Brewster. We haven’t
got the water-wagon bug much out here. They
say it don’t breed well this side o’ the main range.”</p>

<p>“Much drinking among the railroad men?”</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;m&mdash;m&mdash;not so you could notice it.
There’s a rule against it.”</p>

<p>“While they’re on duty, you mean?”</p>

<p>“Any old time.”</p>

<p>“Is that rule enforced?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Maxwell allows it is. He’s sure some Ranahan
when it comes to buckin’ the booze-fighters.”</p>

<p>“Still, there is more or less drinking among the
men; you know there is, don’t you, Archer?”</p>

<p>The young man grinned soberly.</p>

<p>“I ain’t tellin’ no tales out o’ school, Mr.
Sprague, not me,” he drawled.</p>

<p>“Get rid of that notion,” said the big man
sharply. “You are working for Mr. Maxwell
and his rules are your law and gospel. I’ll tell
you what I’ve seen, and then you can tell me what
you’ve seen. I counted sixteen men in one place
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>on this railroad to-day who, within the half-hour
that I was looking on, stopped work either to hit
or to pass a pocket-flask. Now go on.”</p>

<p>“If you hold me up that-away, I reckon maybe
there <i>is</i> a good many empty bottles layin’ round
on the right-o’-way&mdash;more’n what the passengers
throw out o’ the car windows,” was the reluctant
admission.</p>

<p>“And more than there used to be, say, two or
three months ago?”</p>

<p>“Yes; right smart more.”</p>

<p>“I thought so. We don’t need to look any further,
Archer, for the disease itself. Your ‘dry rot’
is very pointedly a wet rot. Booze and the running
of a railroad are two things that won’t mix.
Now we’ll come to the nib of it. Why is there
more drinking now than there used to be?”</p>

<p>The younger man took time to think about it
before he said: “You got me goin’; I don’t know
the answer to that.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t suppose you did,” was the curt rejoinder.
“But you are going to learn the answer,
Archer, my son. It is now four o’clock; by half-past
seven this evening I want you to be back here
prepared to tell me who has been letting down the
fences for the railroad men in this matter of
drinking.”</p>

<p>“Holy Smoke!” exclaimed the ex-cowboy, jarred
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>for once out of his plainsman calm, “how am I
goin’ to do that, Mr. Sprague?”</p>

<p>“That is for you to find out, my boy. If you
don’t use your brain you’ll never know whether
or no you’ve got any. That’s all&mdash;until half-past
seven. You’ll find me here at the hotel.”</p>

<p>It was an even hour before the time appointed
for Tarbell’s return when Maxwell joined the
chemistry expert at the table in the Topaz café
where they usually sat when they could dine together.</p>

<p>At the unfolding of the napkins Sprague said:
“I’ve found your germ, Dick, and things are beginning
to develop. What do you think of that?”&mdash;passing
a bit of dingy coarse-fibred paper across
the table.</p>

<p>Maxwell opened the paper and read the ill-spelled
type-written note it bore.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="no-indent">“<span class="smcap">Mr. Spraig</span>:</p>

<p>“Weer onto you with both feet. keep youre
fingers out ov the geers or maybe youll git em
mashed.</p>

<p class="no-indent right2">“<span class="smcap">A well-Wishur.</span>”</p></div>

<p>“Where did that come from?” asked the superintendent,
plainly amused.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span></p>

<p>“It was pushed under the door of my room upstairs
about half an hour ago. The man who left
it was short, thick-set, smooth-shaven, and he wore
a pepper-and-salt suit and a slouch hat. Also,
his breath smelled of whiskey.”</p>

<p>“You expect me to recognize the description?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know but you might.”</p>

<p>“I don’t,” Maxwell denied. Then his smile of
amusement changed to one of amazement. “How
could you know all these things about this man if
you were on the other side of a closed door, Calvin?”</p>

<p>Sprague laughed. “See how easy it is to jump
to conclusions,” he derided. “I wasn’t on the
other side of a closed door; I was in the corridor
when the fellow passed me, looking for the number
on the door. I saw him leave the note. I’ll ask
one question, and then we’ll dismiss that phase of
the case. Is the wrecking-train back from Lobo
yet?”</p>

<p>“Yes; it came in about four o’clock with the
string of crippled cars. But you say you have
found the germ; does that mean that you are
going to prove up on your assertion about the
epidemic?”</p>

<p>“I can’t tell what it means yet; but I can tell
you the name of the germ. It’s whiskey.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span></p>

<p>“Drinking among the men?”</p>

<p>“Worse than that; drunkenness among the men.
Enough of it, I should say, to account for all of
your troubles and then some.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re off&mdash;’way off!” objected the harassed
one irritably. “I know there is some drinking;
in a wide-open country like this it is almost
impossible to stamp it out entirely. But to account
for the epidemic in that way, you’d have to
imagine every other man in the service carrying a
pocket-pistol on the job!”</p>

<p>“And you think that couldn’t happen without
your knowing it, eh? A little farther along I may
have some statistics to show you; but just now
I’m looking not so much for the germ as for the
germ-carrier.”</p>

<p>Maxwell smiled wearily.</p>

<p>“Still sticking to the theory that the blight is
imported, are you? It’s the only time I’ve ever
known you to be ‘yellow,’ Calvin. I can imagine
some wild-eyed newspaper reporter hatching such
an idea, but not you. Think of the absurdity of a
bunch of Wall Street stock-jobbers trying to get
at us in any such indirect way as that&mdash;shipping
whiskey in here to demoralize our working force!
Pshaw! When these fellows get busy and go to
work, they want action&mdash;quick action.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span></p>

<p>The expert put down his knife and fork and sat
back in his chair.</p>

<p>“You are so close to the thing that you are continually
losing the perspective, Dick,” he said
earnestly. “You are going on the supposition that
those New York looters are trying first one thing
and then another. That doesn’t follow at all.
For all you know, they may be gunning for you in
half a dozen different ways this blessed minute&mdash;as
they probably are. Assume, for the sake of the
argument, that this whiskey scheme could be
worked; I know you say it can’t, but suppose it
could: can you conceive of any expedient that
would be more certain to kill your traffic, wipe out
your earnings, smash your securities, and put
you on the toboggan slide generally?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no; if it could be worked.” Maxwell’s
answer this time was less confidently derisive.</p>

<p>“All right; now that you’ve come that far, I’ll
say this: it can be worked, and I’m here to tell
you that it has been worked. Your railroad is
practically an inebriate asylum in the making,
right now, Richard. Half of your force has already
fallen off the water chariot, and the other
half is scared to death at the thought of what the
drunken half may do.”</p>

<p>Maxwell pushed away his dessert untasted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span></p>

<p>“You have the proof of this, Calvin?” he broke
out.</p>

<p>“I have some proof, and Tarbell is getting more.
You’ve been blind. You didn’t want to admit
that your house of discipline was tumbling about
your ears, and you’ve been shutting your eyes to
the plain facts. For example: you may or may
not be the only man in the service who doesn’t
know that those two freight engineers&mdash;the one
who was killed and the other&mdash;who overran their
orders and smashed into the passenger at Lobo
Cut this morning were just plain drunk!”</p>

<p>“What’s that? It&mdash;it can’t be, Calvin!”</p>

<p>“But it <i>is</i>,” insisted the big man across the
table. “It is common talk among your own men;
so common that it reached out and hit me&mdash;an
outsider.”</p>

<p>The superintendent drank his small coffee at a
single gulp and flung his napkin aside.</p>

<p>“I’ll get ’em!” he gritted savagely. “I’ll get
the last damned booze-fighter in the bunch!”
And then: “Good God, Sprague; how could anything
like this go on without my knowing it?”</p>

<p>“You would have found it out, sooner or later,
of course. But you’re a railroad man yourself,
and you ought to know railroad men well enough
to take into consideration that sort of loyalty
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>among them which keeps them from ‘peaching’
on one another. Even Tarbell had to be jarred
before he would admit that he knew about it.
I can imagine that there has been a sort of generous
conspiracy among the men to keep you from
finding out.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right; I know now, and I’ll sift
them out; I’ll go through the whole blamed outfit
with a club! I’ll&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The man who had called out this upbubbling of
righteous wrath was chuckling softly.</p>

<p>“You won’t do anything that you say you will,”
he interrupted good-naturedly. “You stumped
me to take the case, and I’ve taken it; which
means that you’re under the doctor’s orders.
When you have cooled down a bit, you’ll see very
clearly that the worst thing you could do at this
particular crisis would be to start a division-wide
scrap with the rank and file.”</p>

<p>“But, good Lord, Sprague; I’ve got to do something,
haven’t I?”</p>

<p>“You surely have; and that something is to
help me find the germ-carrier. Somebody has
been taking down the bars for your men; who is
it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know any more than a goat. I can’t
yet believe that it is the work of any one man.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span></p>

<p>“Possibly it isn’t; there may be a good many.
But I’ll chance a guess that some one in authority
is setting the pace. Leave that for a moment and
we’ll take up something else. You have two daily
papers here in Brewster: I’ve noticed that one of
them, <i>The Tribune</i>, is friendly to your road. How
about the other, <i>The Times-Record</i>?”</p>

<p>“It is supposed to be independent, with a slant
against corporations and ‘the system,’ whatever
that may be.”</p>

<p>“Um,” said the scientist. “Before I went out
on this last trip with Billy, I remarked that this
other paper was giving a good bit of space to your
road troubles in its news columns, and a good bit
of its editorial space to criticisms of the Ford
management. It occurred to me then that there
might be a reason. How is the paper organized?”</p>

<p>“It is owned by one of our near-millionaires; a
retired ranchman named Parker Higginson, who
has dabbled in real-estate, in mines, and latterly
in politics. His grouch against the railroad is
purely personal. He has asked favors that I
couldn’t legally grant; and on one occasion he
took offence because I told him that a newspaper
man should be the last person in the world to invite
us to become law-breakers.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span></p>

<p>“And his editor?” queried the expert.</p>

<p>“Is a bird of the same feather; a rather ‘yellow’
little fice named Healy.”</p>

<p>Sprague looked rather dubiously at the two
cigars which the waiter was tendering on a server.
“No, I think not, George,” he said, waving the
cigars aside and feeling for his own pocket-case
of stronger ones. And then to Maxwell: “This is
all very nourishing. It may help out more than
you suspect. Later in the evening I may ask you
to call with me at the office of <i>The Times-Record</i>&mdash;though
we may not have to go that far up the ladder
to find what we are looking for. In the meantime,
Tarbell is waiting for us out yonder in the
lobby. Suppose we go and see what he wants.”</p>

<p>They found the young man, who looked like a
younger brother to Starbuck, and who had made
his record chasing cattle thieves in Montana,
methodically rolling a cigarette in the loggia alcove,
and Sprague began on him briskly.</p>

<p>“Spit it out, Archer; what have you found?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t make out to find what you sent me
after,” was the half-evasive reply.</p>

<p>“All right; tell us what you did find.”</p>

<p>The young man dropped his cigarette and
looked up with a glint of stubbornness in his stone-gray
eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span></p>

<p>“If it’s just the same to you, Mr. Sprague, I’d
a heap ruther not,” he said.</p>

<p>Sprague reached out and turned the lapel of
Tarbell’s coat, exposing the small silver star of a
deputy sheriff.</p>

<p>“You took an oath when you got that, Archer;
and Mr. Maxwell pays you for wearing it.”</p>

<p>Tarbell threw up his head defiantly. “Deputy
or no deputy, I ain’t goin’ to name no names,” he
began slowly. “But here’s what I found out:
I been in twenty-three saloons and dives since
you told me to go chase, and I counted thirty-one
railroad men in ’em. Not all of ’em was drinkin’
or gamblin’, but some of ’em was.”</p>

<p>Sprague turned to Maxwell.</p>

<p>“You see, I knew what I was talking about.”</p>

<p>The superintendent was shaking his head.</p>

<p>“As openly as that!” he exclaimed. “I must
have been the blindest fool in all this hill country!”</p>

<p>Tarbell chipped in quickly. “It ain’t been that
bad for very long. But it’s just as Mr. Sprague
says; it’s spreadin’ like murrain on a dry range.
I saw men in them places this evenin’ that I’d a
swore never got off the water-wagon. I ain’t
namin’ no names.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Maxwell isn’t asking you to give anybody
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>away,” the expert qualified. And then: “Had
your supper?”</p>

<p>Tarbell nodded. “I had a hand-out in one o’
the saloons.”</p>

<p>“Good. Then I’ll give you another job. Look
around town for a man about Mr. Maxwell’s
build, only about twenty pounds heavier. He
is between twenty-five and thirty years old, wears
a slouch hat soft gray in color, dresses in pepper-and-salt,
is clean-shaven, red-faced, blue-eyed, and
walks with a little hitch to his left leg which isn’t
quite a limp. When you catch up with him, find
out who he is and come and tell me. I’ll be over
at Mr. Maxwell’s office.”</p>

<p>Tarbell vanished, rolling a fresh cigarette as he
went, and Sprague thrust his arm in Maxwell’s.</p>

<p>“I’ll go over to your shop with you,” he said.
“I know you’re anxious to climb back into the
working saddle. I’m not going to bore you; I
merely want to have a little talk with that irreproachable
chief clerk of yours, Harvey Calmaine.”</p>

<p>A little later they climbed the stair to the office
floor of the railroad building together, and Maxwell
went on down the corridor to the despatcher’s
room. When he came back to his own office a half-hour
later and found Sprague and young Calmaine
figuring together at the chief clerk’s desk in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>outer room, he went on to his own inner sanctum
without disturbing them.</p>

<p>It was perhaps another half-hour farther along
when the expert, who had been patiently going over
a mass of statistics with the alert, well-groomed
young fellow who served as the superintendent’s
right hand, sat back in his chair and relighted the
fat black cigar which had been suffered to go out
many times during the figuring process.</p>

<p>“It seems that a good many things besides
wrecks have been happening in the past few weeks,
Mr. Calmaine,” he suggested musingly. “In that
short interval you have had many changes in the
force, especially in the motive-power department.
I don’t know whether you have remarked it, but
fully half of the men in the shops and roundhouses
are new men. And that is the department
in which the sickness seems to be the worst. Your
maintenance costs have increased three hundred
per cent. over the same period last year.”</p>

<p>“I know it,” admitted the chief clerk. “It is
the more marked because Dawson, our former
master mechanic, made such phenomenally good
records.”</p>

<p>“I remember Dawson,” said the big man, slipping
easily from the statistics into the humanities.
“He was here the first time I came over the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>road, early in the summer. Has he left the Short
Line?”</p>

<p>“He has been promoted. He is superintendent
of motive-power on the east end of the Southwestern.”</p>

<p>“That is recent, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes; it was only a few weeks ago.”</p>

<p>“And you have a new man as department chief?”</p>

<p>“We have&mdash;Judson Bascom. You may remember
him as the man who ran the special train for
you and Mr. Maxwell the day you made the blind
trip to Tunnel Number Three. He is a sort of
slave-driver and seems to have a good deal of
trouble with his men&mdash;is continually hiring and
firing, you’d say, from the appearance of his pay-rolls.”</p>

<p>The big expert’s eyes narrowed.</p>

<p>“Was he also promoted from some other place
on the system?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No; he is a new man. I don’t know where he
got his experience; somewhere in the East, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Another question,” put in Sprague. “Does
Mr. Maxwell have the appointment of his own
motive-power chief?”</p>

<p>“No; this appointment was made in New York&mdash;by
the executive committee, I imagine.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span></p>

<p>“Somebody’s nephew or brother-in-law?” queried
the chemist, with a twinkle in his eye.</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that. I guess it happens
that way, once in a while, on any railroad. But
Bascom is all kinds of capable.”</p>

<p>Sprague shook his head. “The true test of
capability is always in the final result, my son,” he
said reflectively; adding, “and results nowadays
are usually measured in dollars and cents. As an
outsider, I should say that this Mr. Bascom is a
pretty expensive man to have around, judging from
his cost sheets. He drinks some, doesn’t he?”</p>

<p>The young chief clerk closed one eye gravely.</p>

<p>“I’m not supposed to know anything about
that, Mr. Sprague.”</p>

<p>“No, of course not. As you might say, it’s
nobody’s business but Mr. Bascom’s. By the way,
what is that whistle blowing so persistently for?”</p>

<p>Calmaine leaped out of his chair as if it had been
suddenly connected with the grounding wire of a
forty-kilowatt generator.</p>

<p>“By George! it’s a fire!” he exclaimed; and the
sound of hurrying feet in the corridor confirmed
the surmise. Maxwell’s door opened at the same
instant, and the three rushed out to join the crowd
which was already streaming across the yard
tracks toward the company’s shops.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span></p>

<p>The fire was in the shops, originating in the
boiler-room; and, thanks to the timely alarm and
the comparative earliness of the hour, it was soon
extinguished. Investigation, promptly instituted
on the spot by the superintendent, proved that
it was the result of pure carelessness. Some of
the mechanics had washed their overalls and had
hung them too near the sheet-iron stack in the
fire-room; that was all.</p>

<p>Sprague lingered at Maxwell’s elbow while the
investigation was going on, and he appeared to be
a more or less perfunctory listener when Bascom,
oozing wrathful profanity at every pore, told the
superintendent what he would do to the careless
clothes-driers when they should show up in the
morning. But later, after the return to the head-quarters
offices, the man from Washington sat
for a long time in Maxwell’s easiest chair, smoking
steadily and with his gaze fixed upon the disused
gas chandelier marking the exact centre of the
ceiling.</p>

<p>It was not until after Maxwell had finished his
quota of night work and was closing his desk that
Tarbell came in to make a whispered report to the
big man apparently dreaming in the easy-chair.</p>

<p>Sprague listened, nodded, and rose to join the
office-closing retreat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span></p>

<p>“That is about what I thought, Archer,” he
said soberly. “Now I have one more little job
for you, and when it is done we’ll call it a go for
to-night. Come around to my laboratory with
me and I’ll explain it to you.” And when the
four of them reached the plaza-fronting street he
excused himself to Maxwell and the chief clerk
and went, with Tarbell at his elbow, to the little
second-floor den in the Kinzie Building where his
experiments in soil analysis were conducted.</p>

<p>Reaching the back room which served as the
laboratory proper, Sprague provided his follower
with half a dozen small bottles, empty and tightly
corked.</p>

<p>“There you are,” he said, from which it may be
inferred that the nature of the remaining “job”
had been explained on the way up from the railroad
head-quarters. “Do it neatly, Archer, and
don’t let them catch you at it. Everything will
have quieted down by this time, and you shouldn’t
have any trouble. I’ll wait for you here.”</p>

<p>Tarbell was gone possibly half an hour, and
when he returned the bottles they were filled, two
of them with a black-brown liquid, thick and viscous,
and four with what appeared to be specimens
of more or less dirty water. Each bottle was carefully
marked on the blank label pasted upon it.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>Sprague stood them in a row on the laboratory
working-table.</p>

<p>“I shall be busy here for twenty or thirty minutes,”
he said. “I don’t want to ride a willing
horse to death, but I’d be glad if you’d go by the
hotel and ask Mr. Maxwell to wait up for me. I
want to see him before he goes to bed.”</p>

<p>Tarbell nodded, but he hesitated about going.</p>

<p>“I got a hunch that we ain’t doin’ all the shadow
work by our little lonesomes, Mr. Sprague,” he
ventured to say. But before he could go on,
Sprague lifted a finger for silence, made a whirling
half-turn with a swiftness marvellous in so huge a
body, and flung himself through the open door
into the unlighted outer office-room to which the
laboratory was an inner extension.</p>

<p>There were sounds of a collision, a fall, and a
brief struggle before Tarbell could get action. At
the end of it Sprague came back into the lighted
laboratory, dragging a thick-set, square-shouldered
man in pepper-and-salt clothes; a man with a
clean-shaven red face down the side of which a
thin line of blood was trickling.</p>

<p>“You were eminently correct, Archer,” said
the expert, slamming his unresisting burden into
a corner of the room after he had deftly gone
through the pepper-and-salt pockets for weapons
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>with the result of turning out a cheap revolver
and a wicked-looking knife. “I’m sorry I can’t
keep my word and let you go to bed, but the plot
has thickened a little too rapidly. Go around to
the Topaz and ask Mr. Maxwell to wait. Then
come back here and keep this fellow quiet while
I do my work.”</p>

<p>When Tarbell went out, Sprague quickly
stripped his coat and went to work at his laboratory
table. For some little time the man in the
corner lay as he had been cast, and the worker
at the table paid no attention to him. But a few
minutes before Tarbell’s return, the red-faced man
gasped, gurgled, and sat up to hold his head in his
hands as one trying to remember what had happened
to him. Presently he looked up, and after
a long stare at the big figure of the man at the
work table, he found his voice.</p>

<p>“Say, guv’ner, wot am I doin’ here?” he asked
huskily.</p>

<p>Sprague, who was skilfully dropping a fuming
yellow liquor from a glass-stoppered bottle into
a beaker, replied without turning his head.</p>

<p>“If anybody should ask, I should say you are
waiting for an officer to come and take you to
jail.”</p>

<p>“Who, me? Wot have I been doin’?” queried
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>the husky one, in the anxious rasp of a deeply
aggrieved victim of circumstances.</p>

<p>“You’ve been shoving threatening letters under
my door in the Hotel Topaz, for one thing,”
said Sprague, still busy with his experiment.</p>

<p>“Who, me? My Gawd&mdash;just lissen to ’im!”
wheezed the red-faced man, as if appealing to some
third person invisible.</p>

<p>A silence followed during which the crouching
man’s feet drew themselves by imperceptible
fractions of an inch at a time into position for a
tackling spring. Sprague did not look aside, but
when the leg muscles of the man began to bulge as
if testing themselves for the leap, the worker at
the table spoke again.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t try it if I were you. This stuff
that I am fooling with is nitric acid, ninety-eight
per cent. pure. If any of it should happen to get
spilled on you, there wouldn’t be sweet oil enough
in this town to put the fire out.”</p>

<p>“My Gawd!” gasped the red-faced one, suddenly
sticking his feet out in front of him again;
and just then Tarbell came in.</p>

<p>“I’ll be through in a minute, Archer,” said
the experimenter at the work-table, still without
looking around. “Did you find your man?”</p>

<p>“Yes; and Starbuck is with him. What do
you want me to do with this geezer?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span></p>

<p>“Nothing. I’ll fix him when we’re ready to go.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got a pair of handcuffs,” Tarbell suggested.</p>

<p>“They won’t be needed&mdash;not for this one.”</p>

<p>Tarbell dragged out a chair and sat down,
tilting comfortably against the wall and staring
half-absently at the man in the corner. “Before
I’d let any bare-handed man take my arsenal
away from me and slam me around like that,”
he murmured, quite impersonally.</p>

<p>The man on the floor lifted the challenge
promptly.</p>

<p>“Lemme git up and gimme half a chanst,” he
croaked. “I won’t hurt you none if you don’t
git in the way o’ that door.”</p>

<p>“Not this evenin’,” said Tarbell succinctly;
and there the matter rested until Sprague put his
beakers and test-tubes aside, and, resuming his
coat, took a flat black box from a shelf and slipped
it into his pocket.</p>

<p>“Now we’re ready,” he announced; and then
he turned to the captured spy. “We’re going to
leave you here in the dark for a little while, and
there will be nothing between you and a get-away
but a small matter of fear. After we turn the
lights off I shall leave a few bottles of stuff around
where they will do the most good. If you should
happen to upset one of them in moving about,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>it’s good-by. If it doesn’t burn you to death,
you’ll stifle.”</p>

<p>“My Gawd!” said the captive; and he was still
saying it over softly to himself when they switched
off the lights, shut the office doors, and went away.</p>

<p>“There is a good example of the power of matter
over mind, Archer,” said Sprague whimsically,
when they reached the street. “If that fellow
would use his reason even a little bit he’d know
that I hadn’t made any very elaborate preparations
to hold him; there wasn’t time between the
turning off of the lights and our leaving. Yet I’ll
bet a small chicken worth twenty-five dollars that
we find him still crouching in his corner and afraid
to move when we go back. He saw me using acid
in my little experiment; saw the fumes and probably
got a whiff of them. That was enough.”</p>

<p>They found Maxwell and Starbuck sitting on
the hotel porch, smoking. Sprague took the superintendent
aside.</p>

<p>“It’s rather worse than I thought it was, Dick,”
he began, when they had drawn their chairs a
little apart. “That is my excuse for keeping you
up so late. We have one of the conspirators under
a sort of mental lock and key over at my place in
the Kinzie Building, but he is only a hired striker,
and I’d like to flush the big game. Are you good
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>for a watch-meeting&mdash;you and Starbuck? It may
last all night, and nothing may come of it, but it’s
worth trying.”</p>

<p>Maxwell spread his hands.</p>

<p>“Whatever you say, Calvin,” he acquiesced.
“After the jolt you’ve given me to-night, I can only
get into the harness and pull when you give the
word.”</p>

<p>“All right. We’ll take Tarbell for a guide.
Tarbell, you know your way around in the shops
pretty well, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“I reckon so,” was the young man’s reply.</p>

<p>“We want to go to the foundry, or to some place
near by where we can keep an eye on the pickle
shed. Can you get us there without arousing
anybody’s curiosity?”</p>

<p>“Sure,” said Tarbell.</p>

<p>“Good. Pitch out,” was the curt command,
and the four of them left the hotel to make a circuit
through ill-lighted streets and around the
lower end of the eastern railroad yard to come at
the long line of shop buildings from the rear.</p>

<p>On the way Maxwell inquired curiously: “What
do you know about pickling-sheds, Calvin?”</p>

<p>“I know that every well-regulated foundry has
one where castings which are to be machined are
treated with acid to take the hard sand-scale off.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span></p>

<p>“And why, just why, are you anxious to
get a near-hand view of ours, at this time of
night?”</p>

<p>“I’m hoping we shall find the answer to that in
your foundry yard, Dick. If we don’t, the joke
will be on me.”</p>

<p>The approach to the locomotive-repairing section
of the railroad plant was made through a
river-bank yard littered with slag dumps, piled
flasks, and heaps of scrap iron. There was no
moon, and when they got among the lumber sheds
in the rear of the car-shops the darkness was almost
tangible. But Tarbell knew the ground,
and when he finally called a halt the twin cupola
stacks of the foundry loomed before them in the
darkness and the acrid smell of the warm, moist
moulding sand was in the air.</p>

<p>When the pickling-shed had been located for
him, Sprague chose the waiting-place under a
flask shelter directly opposite and the silent watch
began. For a weary half-hour nothing happened.
Though the month was August, a cool wind crept
down from the Timanyoni snow peaks, and the
splash and gurgle of the near-by river added its
suggestion of chill to the moonless night. Over in
the western yards the night crew was making up
the midnight freights; but with the buildings of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>the plant intervening, the noises of the shifter’s
exhaust and the clankings and crashings of the
shunted cars came faintly to the ears of the
watchers.</p>

<p>On the even hour of one the watchman made
his round. They could see his lantern twinkling
through the windows of the shops, and later he
made a circuit of the outbuildings. His route led
him finally through the foundry, and as he came
out the light of his lantern fell upon the piled
castings and the pickling-troughs, and on the carboys
of vitriol. There were four of the boxed acid-holders
standing under the shed. Sprague drew
down his left cuff and made pencil marks on it in
the darkness when the watchman passed on.</p>

<p>It was possibly fifteen minutes after the watchman
had disappeared when Maxwell broke the
strained silence with a whisper.</p>

<p>“Duck!” he said to Starbuck, who was standing
up. “Dunkell’s coming back&mdash;without his lantern!”</p>

<p>Sprague spread his arms and crushed the other
three back into the shadows. “It isn’t the watchman
this time&mdash;be ready!” he whispered; and as
he said it the figure of a man appeared coming
down the littered roadway from the blacksmith
shop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span></p>

<p>Though he walked in darkness there was no incertitude
about the man’s movements. Turning
abruptly out of the material-road he went straight
to the foundry shed. A moment later a beam of
white light played steadily upon the acid carboys,
a sheltered beam which seemed to come from a
tiny electric search-light. Plainly they saw a pair
of hands place a large bottle on the ground, remove
the stopper, and fix a tin funnel in the neck.
Then one of the carboys was tilted, presumably
by the same pair of hands, though the hands were
invisible now, and a thin stream of the yellow
acid gurgled through the funnel.</p>

<p>When the bottle was filled the carboy slowly
righted itself; the hands came in view again to
remove the funnel and to replace the stopper; and
then the search-light went out with the faint snap
of an electric switch. Almost at the same instant
the watchers saw the figure of the man fading
away into the inner and darker blackness of
the foundry.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to follow him, Tarbell,” said
Sprague, hurriedly; “and we lose out if he discovers
us. Can you pilot us?”</p>

<p>“I can,” asserted Maxwell, and under the superintendent’s
lead the shadow race was begun.</p>

<p>Happily, there was a noisy diversion to make the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>secret pursuit feasible. The train-making clamor
had come down from the western yards, and for the
moment the yard crew was working on the freight-house
tracks opposite the shops. Under cover of
the out-door clamor the four pursuers were able
to close up on the bottle-carrier until they were
treading almost in his footsteps. The route led
through the foundry floor to the machine shop.
On the erecting pits were two locomotives, apparently
ready to be hauled out and put into service
after their period of back-shop repairs.</p>

<p>Into the cab of one of the engines the bottle-bearer
climbed, first placing his burden carefully
in the gangway. A little later they heard him
climbing over the coal in the tender, heard him
remove the cover of the water manhole, and heard
the <i>glug-glug</i> of liquid issuing from a bottle-neck.</p>

<p>Sprague silently drew a small square object
from his pocket, the little flat black box he
had caught up as he was leaving his office in the
Kinzie Building. Then he whispered to Tarbell:
“Cover him, Archer, and don’t hesitate to shoot
if you need to: ready!” At the word there was
a blinding burst of illumination and the report
of a flash-light cartridge, followed instantly by
the crash of the breaking bottle, silence, and black
darkness. Then Sprague’s mellow voice boomed
into the stillness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span></p>

<p>“Come down, Mr. Bascom. We’ve got your
picture, and a man who doesn’t often miss what he
shoots at is covering you with his gun.”</p>

<p>It was a grim little group of five which gathered
in the master mechanic’s room in the office wing
of the machine shop a few minutes after the flash-light
photograph had been taken in the erecting
shop. Bascom’s ruddy flush was gone when he
sat down heavily in his desk chair; but his natty
brown crush hat was pushed back, and the gleam
in his small, lynx-like eyes was not of fear.</p>

<p>“Just name the kind of a hand-spring you’d
like to have me turn, gentlemen,” he said, half-sardonically,
when Tarbell had switched on the
second circuit of incandescents. “I’m not much
of an acrobat, but I’ll do the best I can to amuse
you.”</p>

<p>It was Sprague who did the talking for the prosecution.</p>

<p>“We want to know first who is with you in this
job of inside worm-eating, Mr. Bascom,” he said
coolly.</p>

<p>“Nobody,” came the prompt lie.</p>

<p>Sprague’s smile was affable. “I’m sure you’ll
make one exception,” he urged; “a man named
Murtagh, who was for a little time one of your
shop machinists and who is now a press-repairer
on <i>The Times-Record</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span></p>

<p>Bascom sat up and swore a savage oath.</p>

<p>“So that damned scab has welshed, has he?” he
grated.</p>

<p>Sprague branched off and began again, this time
in the straitly criminal field.</p>

<p>“How many locomotives have you treated with
the acid cure, first and last, Mr. Bascom?”</p>

<p>“Enough so you’ll still be resetting flues in ’em a
year from now.”</p>

<p>This time it was Maxwell’s turn to swear, and
for a minute or two the air of the office was
sulphurous. When the atmosphere had cleared
again, Sprague went on.</p>

<p>“I presume that your defence in court will be
that you were trying an experiment to neutralize
the effect of the alkaline water of this region?”</p>

<p>Bascom grinned appreciatively. “You’re an expert
chemist yourself, Mr. Sprague. The water
in this country, outside of the Park, is pretty
badly alkali, as you probably know.”</p>

<p>“But that defence will scarcely explain why you
put acid in the oil which is used for lubricating
the internal parts of the engines&mdash;cylinders and
valves,” Sprague cut in quietly.</p>

<p>The master mechanic’s chair righted itself with
a crash, and the crash punctuated another blast
of bad language directed at the man who had been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>left crouching in the corner in Sprague’s uptown
laboratory.</p>

<p>“So Murtagh gave you that, too, did he?”
Bascom finished. “It’s your lead, Mr. Sprague;
what do you want me to play?”</p>

<p>“Names,” said the expert curtly.</p>

<p>“But if I say I was playing a lone hand?”</p>

<p>“We should know you were lying. This acid
business may be all your own; but there are other
things. You’ve had plenty of help in the drink-fest
and the demoralization game, Bascom.”</p>

<p>The big master mechanic’s lips shut like the
jaws of a steel trap. But after a time he said:
“What do I get if I spout on the others?”</p>

<p>“A chance to get out of the country&mdash;eh,
Maxwell?”</p>

<p>The superintendent nodded. “Yes; if he can
get away before I can find a gun to kill him with.”</p>

<p>Bascom reached into his desk, found a scratch-pad
and tossed it over to Starbuck. “Take ’em
down,” he said briefly; and then followed a black-list
that was simply heart-breaking to Richard
Maxwell, a man who had built his reputation as
a railroad executive, and would have staked it
instantly, upon the loyalty of his rank and file.
Shop foremen, roundhouse bosses, bridge men,
yard foremen, section bosses, a travelling engineer,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>a clerk here and a telegraph operator there&mdash;the
list seemed endless.</p>

<p>When Bascom paused, Sprague began again.</p>

<p>“What was the plan, Bascom, as it was outlined
to these others?”</p>

<p>The master mechanic’s smile showed his fine
even teeth.</p>

<p>“To make this jerk-water railroad a little easier
to work for,” he sneered. “When we found the
right kind of a man we made him believe that the
discipline was keyed up too damned tight and
showed him how he could loosen up a little, if he
felt like it. Murtagh was barkeep’ and handed
out the bug-juice. That’s all there was to it.”</p>

<p>“Not quite all,” said Sprague evenly. “You
got Murtagh his job on <i>The Times-Record</i> in order
to have him handy without being too much in the
way or too much in evidence. How much do the
<i>Times-Record</i> people know about the scheme for
smashing the Nevada Short Line securities from
the inside?”</p>

<p>Bascom laughed hardily.</p>

<p>“You’ll never catch a newspaper man,” he
said. “But I’ll tell you this: Parker Higginson is
a pretty smooth politician, and he’s got a mighty
long arm when it comes to reaching for the thing
he wants. He was the man who got me my job
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>here, and I’ll bet those New York people who appointed
me don’t know yet why they did it. Another
thing: when I’m gone, Higginson will still
be here&mdash;don’t you forget that!”</p>

<p>“We’ll try to remember it,” Sprague promised.
Then he looked at his watch. “The overland
passenger, westbound, will be here in a few minutes,
and when it goes, you may go with it, Mr.
Bascom. But first we want a few more names,
the names of the New York people who are behind
both you and Mr. Higginson.”</p>

<p>Bascom got up, went to a wardrobe in one corner
of the office, and dragged out two heavy
suit-cases.</p>

<p>“I’ve been fixed for this for some little time,”
he volunteered. “Send Murtagh to the stone-pile
for splitting on us, and I won’t make any
claim for the half-month’s salary that’s due me.
As to the names of the big fellows, I only wish I
knew them, Mr. Sprague. If I did, I’d go east
instead of west and make somebody come across
with big money. As it is, I guess it’s South America
for mine. Good-night, all. I wish you luck
with the booze-fighters, Mr. Maxwell. You’ll
have a bully good time loading some of them back
onto the water-automobile.” And he went out
into the night with a suit-case in either hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span></p>

<p>“Talk about cold gall!” said Starbuck, when the
door closed behind the retreating figure of the big
master mechanic; “Great Cat! that fellow’s got
enough to swim in.” Then he turned to Sprague.
“Is the show over?”</p>

<p>The man from Washington laughed genially.</p>

<p>“That is for Maxwell to say. We might go uptown
and give those newspaper people a bad
quarter of an hour, though I doubt if we’d make
any money at it.”</p>

<p>Maxwell looked up quickly.</p>

<p>“You think they’re in it, Calvin? Bascom
wasn’t lying about that part of it?”</p>

<p>“Yes; they are in it up to their necks. I suppose
it’s politics for Higginson. Haven’t I heard
somewhere that he is one of the State bosses?”</p>

<p>“You might have,” drawled Starbuck. “He’s
It, all right.”</p>

<p>Sprague stood up and yawned sleepily.</p>

<p>“Perhaps, a little later on, we can throw a scare
into this Mr. Parker Higginson,” he suggested.
“Just now, I’m for the hotel and a few winks of
much-needed sleep. Tarbell, you go up to my
office and get Murtagh. Have him locked up on
a charge of&mdash;oh, any old charge will do; breaking
into my office to-night, if you can’t think of anything
better. If we can manage to hold onto him
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>for a while, we may be able to keep this Mr.
Higginson quiet while Maxwell is straightening
out his booze-fighters. Let’s go.”</p>

<p>“Hold on, just a minute,” pleaded Maxwell.
“There are three of us here who have seen the
wheels go round, and I don’t forget that I was the
one who said there weren’t any wheels. How in
the name of all that is wonderful have you been
able to work this puzzle out in less than twelve
hours, Sprague?”</p>

<p>The big chemistry expert sat down again and
locked his hands behind his head.</p>

<p>“My gosh!” he said; “have I got to open up
a kindergarten for you fellows when I’m so sleepy
that I don’t know what I’m going to have for
breakfast to-morrow morning? It was easy, dead
easy. Half an hour with those delayed train
crews at Angels this morning showed me that the
discipline strings were all off; one of the freight
conductors even offered me a nip out of his pocket-flask
when I intimated that I was thirsty. With
that for a pointer, I had my eyes open at the
wreck, and what I saw there you all know. Moreover,
I noticed that the pocket-flasks were all
alike, as if they’d all been handed out over the
same bar. All straight, so far?”</p>

<p>“Go on,” said Maxwell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span></p>

<p>“I got my first pointer on Bascom at the wreck,
too. I saw that the men in the trainmaster’s
gang didn’t drink when the boss was looking, a
condition which didn’t apply in the other crew.
Again, I noticed that Bascom took his track-clearing
privilege with a large and handsome
disregard for the salvage. He didn’t care how
much property was destroyed in the process, and
once I saw him give the signal to the crane engineer
to drop a car loaded with automobiles&mdash;which
was promptly done and the autos properly
smashed.”</p>

<p>“The cold-blooded devil!” growled the superintendent.</p>

<p>“When we reached town, Tarbell here promptly
confirmed my guess about the whiskey; and in
the evening Calmaine helped some more by going
with me over the pay-rolls for new names, and
over the cost-sheets for increases. Naturally,
we dwelt longest upon the motive-power and repair
department, with its huge increases, and it so
happened that my eye fell upon the various charges
for vitriol in carboys. I asked Calmaine what use
a railroad shop had for so much sulphuric acid,
and he told me it was used to pickle castings.
Afterward I sent Tarbell out to bring me samples
of water from the tanks of the crippled locomotives
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>on the shop track and of the oil in their cylinder-cups.
Analyses of both, which I made on the
spot, showed the presence of sulphuric acid in the
water, and also in the oil.”</p>

<p>“Still, you didn’t have any cinch on Bascom,”
Starbuck put in.</p>

<p>“No, but things were leaning pretty heavily his
way. Tarbell had traced Murtagh for me and
had found out the one thing that I needed to
know; namely, that Murtagh had been ‘placed’ on
<i>The Times-Record</i> by Bascom’s recommendation.
Murtagh was the man who put the threatening
note under my door; the note was printed on a
scrap of scratch-paper&mdash;copy paper&mdash;of the sort
that you rarely find outside of a newspaper office.
Here I simply put two and two together. Bascom
had been conferring with Higginson, or his editor,
or both of them, and telling them of my rubbernecking
at the wreck. They had agreed among
themselves that I’d better be warned off the grass,
and they took about the stupidest possible way
they could think of to do it.”</p>

<p>“Still, you didn’t have Bascom,” reiterated
Starbuck.</p>

<p>“No; but he was the man who had been signing
the requisitions for the big purchases of acid,
and I was far enough along to chance a jump at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>him. I knew that if he were the man who was
poisoning the locomotives, he wasn’t trusting
anybody else; he was doing it himself, often and
by littles. I wasn’t at all sure of catching him
to-night, of course; but we saw him down here at
the fire, and I thought there was an even chance
that he might stay and do a little more devilment.”</p>

<p>Maxwell stood up and shook himself into his
coat.</p>

<p>“I’m onto you now, Sprague,” he chuckled, in
a brave attempt to jolly himself out of the depressive
nightmare which had been weighing him down
for weeks. “You’re a guesser&mdash;a bold, bad four-flusher,
with a perfectly miraculous knack of drawing
the other card you need when you reach for it.
Now, if you could only guess me out some way in
which I can straighten up these poor fellows of
mine who have been pulled neck and heels off of
the water-wagon&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Pshaw! that’s a cinch,” said the big man,
yawning sleepily again. “We’ll just put our heads
together and get out a little circular letter, talking
to the boys just as you’d talk to a bunch of them in
your office. Tell ’em it’s all off, and the bar is
closed and padlocked, and you’ll have ’em all
eating out of your hand again, same as they used
to. You don’t believe it can be done? You let
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>me write the letter and I’ll show you. All you
have to do is to apply the scientific principle; surround
the whole subject and look at it calmly and
dispassionately, and&mdash;ye-ow! Say, I’m going to
chance another guess&mdash;the last in the box. If
you don’t head me over to the hotel and my
room, you’ll have to carry me over and put me to
bed. And that’s no joke, with a man of my size.
Let’s go.”</p>

<span class="reduce">The Cloud-Bursters</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">I</span>T was an article in the news columns of <i>The
Brewster Morning Tribune</i> which first called
attention&mdash;the attention of the Brewsterites and
the inter-mountain world in general&mdash;to the plans
and purposes of the Mesquite Valley Land and
Irrigation Company.</p>

<p>Connabel, a hard-working reporter on <i>The
Tribune</i>, had been sent over to Angels, the old
head-quarters of the Red Butte Western on the
other side of the Timanyonis, to get the story of
a shooting affray which had localized itself in
Pete Grim’s place, the one remaining Angelic
saloon. Finding the bar-room battle of little
worth as a news story, and having time to kill between
trains, Connabel had strolled off up the
gulch beyond the old copper mines and had stumbled
upon the construction camp of the Mesquite
Company.</p>

<p>Being short of “copy” on the fight story, the
reporter had written up the irrigation project, taking
the general outlines from a foreman on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>job whose tongue he loosened with a handful of
Brewster cigars. A big earth dam was in process
of construction across the mouth of the rather
precipitous valley of Mesquite Creek; and the
mesa below, which, to Connabel’s unrural eye,
seemed to be a very Sahara of infertile desolation,
was to be made to blossom like the rose.</p>

<p>Kendall, managing editor of <i>The Tribune</i>, had
run the story, partly because real news happened
to be scarce at the moment, and partly out of sheer
astonishment that an enterprise of the magnitude
of the Mesquite project had not already flooded
the country with the brass-band publicity literature
which is supposed to attract investors.</p>

<p>That a land and irrigation company should
actually wait until its dam was three-fourths completed
before it began to advertise was a thing
sufficiently curious to call for editorial comment.
Why Editor Kendall did not comment on the news
item as a matter of singular interest is a query
which had its answer on the loggia porch of the
Hotel Topaz in the evening of the day on which
Connabel’s write-up appeared.</p>

<p>It was Kendall’s regular habit to close his desk
at seven o’clock and to spend a leisurely hour over
his dinner at the Topaz before settling down to
his night’s work. On the evening in question he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>had chanced to sit at table with Maxwell, the
general superintendent of the railroad, and with
Maxwell’s friend and college classmate, Sprague.
After dinner the three had gone out to the loggia
porch to smoke, and it was the big chemistry expert
who spoke of the Mesquite news story which
had appeared that morning in <i>The Tribune</i>.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the editor; “Connabel got on to
that yesterday. I sent him over to Angels to write
up a shooting scrape, and he had more time on his
hands than he knew what to do with. We’ve all
known, in a general way, that an Eastern company
was doing something over there, but I had no
idea that they’d got their dam pretty nearly done
and were about ready to open up for business.”</p>

<p>“It’s wild-cat, pure and unadulterated!” cut in
the railroad man snappily. “What they are going
to do to a lot of woolly investors will be good and
plenty. That Mesquite Mesa land is just about
as fertile as this street pavement here.”</p>

<p>Kendall was a dried-up little wisp of a man, with
tired eyes and a face the color of old oak-tanned
leather.</p>

<p>“That is what you would think&mdash;that they are
out for the easy money,” he agreed. “But there
is something a little queer about it. They haven’t
advertised.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span></p>

<p>“Not here,” supplemented Maxwell. “It would
be a trifle too rank. Everybody in the Timanyoni
knows what that land is over in the edge of the
Red Desert.”</p>

<p>“They haven’t advertised anywhere, so far as I
can ascertain,” put in the editor, quietly. “What
is more, Jennings, who is the engineer in charge of
the dam-building and who seems to be the only
man in authority on the ground, came in this afternoon
and raised sand with me for printing the
news story. He said they were not exploiting the
scheme here at all; that their money and their investors
were all in the East, and they were asking
no odds of the Brewster newspapers.”</p>

<p>“Bitter sort of devil, that fellow Jennings,” was
Maxwell’s comment; but it was the big chemist
who followed the main thread of the argument.</p>

<p>“What reason did he give for making such an
extraordinary break as that, Mr. Kendall?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he had his reason pat enough,” rejoined
the editor, with his tired smile. “He said he realized
that we have irrigated land of our own over
here in the Park upon which we are anxious to get
settlers, and that public sentiment here would
naturally be against the Mesquite project. He
asked, as a matter of fairness, that we simply let
the desert project alone. He claimed that it had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>been financed without taking a dollar out of the
Timanyoni, so we could not urge that there were
local investors to be protected.”</p>

<p>“Umph! that argument cuts both ways; it’s an
admission that the Eastern investors might need
protection,” scoffed the railroad superintendent.
Then he added: “They certainly will if they expect
to get any of the money back that they have been
spending in Mesquite Valley. Why, Kendall,
Mesquite Creek is bone-dry half the year!”</p>

<p>“And the other half?” inquired Sprague.</p>

<p>“It’s a cloud-burst proposition, like a good many
of the foot-hill arroyos,” Maxwell explained.
“Once, in a summer storm, I saw a wall of water
ten feet high come down that stream-bed, tumbling
twenty-ton bowlders in the thick of it as if
they had been brook pebbles. Then, for a month,
maybe, it would be merely a streak of dry sand.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps they are counting upon storing the
cloud-burst water,” commented Kendall dryly.
Then as he rose to go back to his work: “As you
say, Maxwell, it has all the ear-marks of the wild-cat.
But so long as it doesn’t stick its claws out
at us, I suppose we haven’t much excuse for butting
in. Good-night, gentlemen. Drop in on me
when you’re up my way. Always glad to see
you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span></p>

<p>The two who remained on the hotel porch after
the editor went away smoked in comradely silence
for a time. The night was enchantingly fine, with
a first-quarter moon swinging low in a vault of
velvety blackness, and a gentle breeze, fragrant
with the breath of the mountain forests, creeping
down upon the city from the backgrounding highlands.
Across the plaza, and somewhere in the
yards behind the long two-storied railroad head-quarters
building and station, a night crew was
making up trains, and the clank and crash of
coupling cars mingled with the rapid-fire exhausts
of the switching engine.</p>

<p>The big-bodied chemistry expert was the first
to break the companionable silence, asking a
question which had reference to the epidemic of
disaster and demoralization which had recently
swept over Maxwell’s railroad.</p>

<p>“Well, how are things coming by this time,
Dick? Are the men responding fairly well to that
little circular-letter, man-to-man appeal we concocted?”</p>

<p>“They are, for a fact,” was the hearty assurance.
“I have never seen anything like it in railroading
in all my knocking about. They’ve been coming
in squads to ’fess up and take the pledge, and to
assure me that it’s the water-wagon for theirs
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>from now on. By George, Calvin, it’s the most
mellowing experience I’ve ever had! It proves
what you have always said, and what I have always
wanted to believe: that the good in the mass
definitely outweighs the bad, and that it will come
to the front if you only know how to appeal to it.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” averred the chemist. “It is the
strong hope of the country that there is justice
and fairness and sane common-sense at the American
bottom of us, if you can only get at it. I
think you can call the booze-fight and demoralization
round-up a trouble past and begin to look
around you for the signs and symptoms of the next
biff you’re going to get.”</p>

<p>The stockily built little man who stood as the
railroad company’s chief field-officer on the far-western
fighting line moved uneasily in his chair.</p>

<p>“I have been hoping there wasn’t going to be
any ‘next time,’” he said, chewing thoughtfully
upon his cigar.</p>

<p>“I should hope with you, Dick, if we had been
able, in any of the former scrimmages, to secure
good, indubitable court evidence against the men
who are backing these buccaneering raids on your
securities. The one thing that big money really
fears to-day is the law&mdash;the law as the Federal
courts are likely to construe and administer it.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>But to obtain your day in court you’ve got to have
evidence; and thus far we haven’t been able to
sweat out anything that would implicate the man
or men higher up. Therefore, you may continue
to sleep on your arms, keeping a sharp eye out for
surprises.”</p>

<p>“I guess that is pretty good advice,” was the
ready admission; “but it is rather difficult to put
into practice, Calvin. There are five hundred
miles of this railroad, and my job of operating
them is big enough to keep me busy without doing
any detective stunts on the side.”</p>

<p>“I know,” Sprague nodded reflectively, “and
for that reason I’ve been half-way keeping an eye
out for you myself.”</p>

<p>“You have? Don’t tell me you’ve been finding
more grief!”</p>

<p>Sprague threw away his outburned stub and
found and lighted a fresh cigar.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to pose as an alarmist,” he offered
at length, “but I’d like to dig a little deeper into
this Mesquite irrigation scheme. How much or
little do you know about it?”</p>

<p>“Next to nothing. About two months ago
Jennings, the construction engineer, made application
for the through handling, from Copah, of a
train-load of machinery, tools, and camp outfit.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>He asked to have the stuff delivered at the end of
the old copper-mine spur above Angels. We put
the spur in shape for him and delivered the
freight.”</p>

<p>“Well, what else?”</p>

<p>“That is about all we have had to do with them
in a business way. Two weeks ago, when we had
that wreck at Lobo, they were asking Benson for
an extension of the copper-mine spur to a point
nearer their job, chiefly, I think, so they could run
a hand-car back and forth between the camp and
the saloon at Angels. Benson didn’t recommend
it, and the matter was dropped.”</p>

<p>“Without protest?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; Jennings didn’t make much of a roar.
In fact, I’ve always felt that he avoided me when
he could. He is in town a good bit, but I rarely
see him. Somebody told me he tried once to get
into the Town and Country Club, and didn’t
make it. I don’t know who would blackball him,
or why; but evidently some one did.”</p>

<p>The ash grew a full half-inch longer on Sprague’s
fresh cigar before he said:</p>

<p>“Doesn’t it occur to you that there is something
a bit mysterious about this dry-land irrigation
scheme, Dick?”</p>

<p>“I had never thought of it as being mysterious.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>It is a palpable swindle, of course; but swindles
are like the poor&mdash;they’re always with us.”</p>

<p>“It interests me,” said the big man, half-musingly.
“A company, formed nobody knows
where or how, drops down in the edge of the Red
Desert and begins&mdash;absolutely without any of the
clatter and clamor of advertising that usually go
with such enterprises&mdash;to build what, from all reports,
must be a pretty costly dam. If they have
acquired a title to the Mesquite Mesa, no one
seems to have heard of it; and if they are hoping
to sell the land when the dam is completed, that,
too, has been kept dark. Now comes this little
newspaper puff this morning, and Mr. Jennings
promptly turns up to ask Kendall to drop it.”</p>

<p>“It is rather queer, when you come to put the
odds and ends of it together,” admitted the railroad
man.</p>

<p>“Decidedly queer, I should say.” So far the
Government man went on the line which he himself
had opened. Then he switched abruptly.
“By the way, where is your brother-in-law, Starbuck?
I haven’t seen him for three or four days.”</p>

<p>“Billy has been in Red Butte, figuring on a little
mining deal in which we are both interested. But
I am looking for him back to-night.”</p>

<p>“Good. If you should happen to see him when
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>the train comes in, ask him to come over here and
smoke a pipe with me. Tell him I’m losing my
carefully acquired cowboy accent and I’d like to
freshen it up a bit.”</p>

<p>The superintendent promised; and, since he always
had work to do, went across to his office in
the second story of the combined head-quarters
and station building.</p>

<p>Some hour or so later the evening train came in
from the west, and at the outpouring of passengers
from it one, a man whose air of prosperous independence
was less in the grave, young-old face
and the loosely fitting khaki service clothes than in
the way in which he carried his shoulders, was met
by a boy from the superintendent’s office, and the
word passed sent him diagonally across the grass-covered
plaza to swing himself lightly over the
railing of the hotel porch.</p>

<p>“Dick made motions as if you wanted to smoke
a peace pipe with me,” he said, dropping carelessly
into the chair which had been Maxwell’s.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Sprague assented; and then he went on
to explain why. At the end of the explanation
Starbuck nodded.</p>

<p>“I reckon we can do it all right; go up on the
early-morning train to the canyon head, and take
a chance on picking up a couple of bronc’s at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>Wimberley’s ranch. But we could hoof it over
from Angels in less than a quarter of the time it’ll
take us to ride up the river from Wimberley’s.”</p>

<p>“For reasons of my own, Billy, I don’t want to
‘hoof it,’ as you say, from Angels. To mention
one of them, I might ask you to remember that I
tip the scale at a little over the half of the third
hundred, just now, and I’m pretty heavy on my
feet.” And therewith the matter rested.</p>

<p>At an early hour the following morning, an hour
when the sun was just swinging clear over the far-distant
blue horizon line of the Crosswater Hills
which marks the eastern limit of the great desert,
two men dropped from the halted eastbound train
at the Timanyoni Canyon water-tank and made
their way around the nearest of the hogbacks to
the ranch house of one William Wimberley.</p>

<p>As Starbuck had predicted, two horses were obtainable,
though the ranchman looked long and
dubiously at the big figure of the Government
chemist before he was willing to risk even the
heaviest of the horses in his small <i>remuda</i>.</p>

<p>“I reckon you’ll have ter set sort o’ light in the
saddle, Mister,” he said at the mounting; and
then, apparently as an after-thought: “By gollies,
I wouldn’t have you fall over ag’inst me f’r a farm
in God’s country, stranger! Ef you was to live
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>round here, we’d call you Samson, and take up
a c’lection fer the pore, sufferin’ Philistines. We
shore would.”</p>

<p>Sprague laughed good-naturedly as he followed
Starbuck’s lead toward the river. He was well
used to being joked about his size, and there were
times when he rather encouraged the joke. Big
men are popularly supposed to be more or less
helpless, physically, and Sprague was enough of a
humorist to enjoy the upsetting, now and then,
of the popular tradition. In his college days he
had held the record for the heavy lift and the broad
jump; there was no man of his class who could
stand up to him with the gloves or on the wrestling-mat;
and in the foot-ball field he was at once the
strongest “back” and the fastest man on the team&mdash;a
combination rare enough to be miraculous.</p>

<p>“You say you want to follow the river?” said
Starbuck, when they had struck in between the
precipitous hills among which the green flood of the
Timanyoni made its way toward the canyon portal.</p>

<p>“Yes, if it is at all practicable. I’d like to get
some idea of the lay of the land between this and
the camp on the Mesquite.”</p>

<p>“I’m anticipatin’ that you’ll get the idea, good
and plenty,” agreed the superintendent’s brother-in-law
dryly; and during the three-hour jaunt that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>followed, the prediction was amply confirmed.
There was no trail, and for the greater part of the
way the river flowed between rocky hogbacks, with
only the narrowest of bowlder-strewn margins on
either hand.</p>

<p>Time and again they were forced to dismount
and to lead the horses around or over the natural
obstructions; and once they were obliged to leave
the river valley entirely, climbing and descending
again by a circuitous route among the rugged hills.</p>

<p>It was late in the forenoon when they came
finally into the region of upper basins, and, turning
to the eastward, threaded a dry arroyo which
brought them out upon the level-bottomed valley
known as the Mesquite Mesa. It was not a mesa
in the proper meaning of the term; it was rather
a vast flat wash brought down from the hills by
the sluicing of many floods. Here and there its
sun-baked surface was cut and gashed by dry gullies
all pointing toward the river, and each bearing
silent witness to the manner in which the mesa
had been formed.</p>

<p>At a point well within this shut-in moraine,
Sprague dismounted, tossed his bridle reins to Starbuck,
and went to examine the soil in the various
gullies. Each dry ditch afforded a perfect cross-section
of the different strata, from the thin layer
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>of sandy top-soil to the underlying beds of coarse
sandstone pebbles and gravel. Sprague kicked the
edges from a dozen of the little ditches, secured a
few handfuls of the soil, and came back shaking
his head.</p>

<p>“I don’t wonder that these people don’t want to
advertise their land, Billy,” he commented, climbing,
with a nimbleness astonishing in so large a
man, to the back of his mount. “As they say
down in Tennessee, you couldn’t raise a fuss on it.
Let’s amble along and see what they are doing at
the head works.”</p>

<p>At the head of the wash the valley of Mesquite
Creek came in abruptly from the right. On a
bench above the mouth of the valley they found
the construction camp of the irrigation company,
a scattered collection of shack sheds and tents, a
corral for the working stock, and the usual filth
and litter characterizing the temporary home of
the “wop.”</p>

<p>Across the valley mouth a huge earthwork was
rising. It was the simplest form of construction
known to the dam-building engineer: a mere
heaping of earth and gravel moved by two-horse
scrapers from the slopes of the contiguous hills on
either hand. There was no masonry, no concrete,
not even the thin core wall which modern engineering
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>practice prescribes for the strengthening member
in an earth embankment designed to retain
any considerable body of water.</p>

<p>Moreover, there was no spillway. The creek,
carrying at this season of the year its minimum
flow, had been stopped off without an outlet; and
the embankment upon which the force was heaping
the scrapings from the hillsides was already
retaining a good-sized lake formed by the checked
waters of the stream.</p>

<p>Starbuck and Sprague had drawn rein at the
outskirts of the construction camp, and they were
not molested until Sprague took a flat black box
from his pocket, opened it into a camera, and was
preparing to take a snap-shot of the dam. At
that, a man who had been lounging in the door of
the camp commissary, a dark-faced, black-bearded
giant in brown duck and service leggings, crossed
the camp street and threw up a hand in warning.</p>

<p>“Hey, there; hold on&mdash;that don’t go!” he
shouted gruffly, striding up to stand squarely in
the way of the camera. “You can’t take any pictures
on this job.”</p>

<p>“Sorry,” said Sprague, giving the intruder his
most amiable smile, “but you were just a half-second
too late,” and he closed the camera into
its box-like shape and dropped it into his pocket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span></p>

<p>The black-bearded man advanced threateningly.</p>

<p>“This is company property, and you are trespassers,”
he rasped. “Give me that camera!”</p>

<p>Starbuck’s right hand went softly under his
coat and stayed there, and his steady gray eyes
took on the sleepy look that, in his range-riding
days, had been a sufficient warning to those who
knew him. Sprague lounged easily in his saddle
and ignored the hand extended for the camera.</p>

<p>“You are Mr. Jennings, I take it,” he said, as
one who would temporize and gain time. “Fine
dam you are building there.”</p>

<p>“<i>Give me that camera!</i>”</p>

<p>Sprague met the angry eyes of the engineer and
smiled back into them.</p>

<p>“I’ll take it under consideration,” he said, half-jocularly.
“You’ll give me a little time to think
about it, won’t you?”</p>

<p>Jennings’s hand dropped to the butt of the
heavy revolver sagging at his hip.</p>

<p>“Not a damned minute!” he barked. “Hand
it over!”</p>

<p>Starbuck was closing up slowly on the opposite
side of his companion’s horse, a movement which
he brought about by a steady knee pressure on
the bronco’s off shoulder. Jennings’s fingers were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>closing around the grip of his pistol when the
astounding thing happened. Without so much as
a muscle-twitching of warning Sprague’s left hand
shot out, the fingers grappled an ample breast-hold
on the engineer’s coat and shirt-bosom, and
Jennings was snapped from his feet and flung, back
down, across the horn of Sprague’s saddle much
as if his big body had been a bag of meal. Starbuck
reached over, jerked the engineer’s weapon
from its holster, broke it to eject the cartridges,
and flung it away.</p>

<p>“Now you can get down,” said Sprague quietly;
and when he loosed the terrible clutch, Jennings
slid from the saddle-horn and fell, cursing like a
maniac.</p>

<p>“Stand still!” ordered Starbuck, when the
engineer bounded to his feet and started to run
toward the commissary, and the weapon that made
the bidding mandatory materialized suddenly
from an inner pocket of the ex-cowman’s khaki
riding-coat.</p>

<p>But the trouble, it seemed, was just fairly getting
under way. Up from the embankment where
the scrapers were dumping came two or three
foremen armed with pick-handles. The commissary
was turning out its quota of rough-looking
clerks and time-keepers, and a mob of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>foreign laborers&mdash;the shift off duty&mdash;came pouring
out of the bunk houses and shacks.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<p class="caption">Sprague had unlimbered and focussed his camera again and was<br />

<p>Sprague had unlimbered and focussed his camera
again and was calmly taking snap-shot after
snap-shot: of the dam, of the impounded lake,
of the up-coming mob, and of the black-bearded
man held hands-up in the middle of the camp
street. When he shut the box on the last of the
exposures he turned to Starbuck with a whimsical
smile wrinkling at the corners of his eyes.</p>

<p>“They don’t seem to be very enthusiastic about
keeping us here, Billy,” he said, with gentle
irony. “Shall we go?”</p>

<p>Starbuck shook the reins over the neck of his
mount and the two horses wheeled as one and
sprang away down the rough cart-road leading to
the end of the copper-mine spur above Angels.
At the retreat, some one on the commissary porch
began to pump a repeating rifle in the general
direction of the pair, but no harm was done.</p>

<p>Starbuck was the first to break the galloping
silence when an intervening hill shoulder had cut
off the backward view of the camp at the dam, and
what he said was purely complimentary.</p>

<p>“You sure have got your nerve with you, and
the punch to back it up,” he chuckled. “I
reckon I’m goin’ to wake up in the middle of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>night laughin’ at the way you snatched that rustler
out of his tracks and slammed him across the saddle.
I’d give a heap to be able to do a thing like
that; I sure would.”</p>

<p>“Call it a knack,” rejoined Sprague modestly.
“You pick up a good many of those little tricks
when you’re training on the squad. Perhaps
you’ve never thought of it, but the human body
is easier to handle, weight for weight, than any
inanimate object could possibly be. That is one
of the first things you learn in tackling on the
foot-ball field.”</p>

<p>They were jogging along slowly by this time
and had passed the copper-mine switch on the
road leading to the station at Angels. Starbuck
was not over-curious, but the experiences of the
forenoon were a little puzzling. Why had his
companion wished to take the long, hard ride up
the valley of the Timanyoni? And why, again,
had he taken the chance of a fight for the sake of
securing a few snap-shot pictures of the irrigation
company’s construction camp and dam? A third
query hinged itself upon the decidedly inhospitable,
not to say hostile, attitude of Jennings, the
irrigation company’s field-officer. Why should he
object so strenuously to the common sight-seer’s
habit of kodaking anything and everything in sight?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span></p>

<p>Starbuck was turning these things over in his
mind when they reached Angels. As they rode
into town Sprague glanced at his watch.</p>

<p>“I have been wondering if we couldn’t get this
man Dickery at the town corral to take charge of
these horses of ours until Wimberley can come and
get them?” he said. “That would make it possible
for us to catch the eleven-thirty train for Brewster.”</p>

<p>Starbuck said it was quite feasible, and by the
time they had disposed of the horses the train
was whistling for the station. When they boarded
the train, Sprague proposed that they postpone
the mid-day meal in the diner in order to ride out
on the rear platform of the observation-car.</p>

<p>“We’ll get to town in time for a late luncheon
at the hotel,” was the way he put it; “and on as
fine a day as this I like to ride out of doors and take
in the scenery.”</p>

<p>Starbuck acquiesced, and smiled as one well used
to the scenery. Truly, the trip through the Timanyoni
Canyon was one which usually brought the
tourists crowding to the rear platform of the train,
but until the morning of this purely sight-seeing
jaunt he had been thinking that Maxwell’s big
friend was altogether superior to the scenic attractions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span></p>

<p>Now, however, Sprague seemed greatly interested
in the canyon passage. Again and again
he called his companion’s attention to the engineering
difficulties which had been overcome in building
the narrow pathway for the rails through the
great gorge. Particularly, he dwelt upon the
stupendous cost of making the pathway, and
upon the temerarious courage of the engineers in
adopting a grade so near, in dozens of places, to
the level of the foaming torrent at the track-side.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Starbuck agreed; “it sure did cost a
heap of money. Dick says the thirty-six miles are
bonded at one hundred thousand dollars a mile,
and even that didn’t cover the cost of construction
on some of the miles.”</p>

<p>“But why did they put the grade so close to the
river level?” persisted the expert, when the foam
from a mid-stream bowlder breathed a misty
breath on them as the train slid past. “Isn’t
there constant trouble from high water?”</p>

<p>“No, the Timanyoni’s a tolerably dependable
creek,” was Starbuck’s answer. “Summer and
winter it holds its own, with nothing like the variation
you find in the Mississippi Valley rivers. An
eight-foot rise is the biggest they’ve ever recorded
at the High Line dam, so J. Montague Smith tells
me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span></p>

<p>“They are fixed to take care of that much of a
rise at the High Line dam, are they?” queried
Sprague.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; I reckon they could take a bigger one
than that, if they had to. That dam is built for
keeps. Williams, who was the constructing engineer,
says that the dam and plant will stand
when the water of the river is pouring through the
second-story windows of the power-house.”</p>

<p>“And that, you would say, would never happen?”
put in the expert thoughtfully, adding,
“If it should happen, your brother-in-law would
have to build him a new railroad through this
canyon, wouldn’t he?”</p>

<p>“He sure would. That eight-foot rise I spoke
of gave them a heap of trouble up here&mdash;washouts
to burn!”</p>

<p>“What caused that rise&mdash;rains?”</p>

<p>“Rains and cloud-bursts, in the season of the
melting snows. It was just as Smith was turning
heaven and earth upside down to get the dam completed,
and for a little spell they sure was anticipatin’
trouble a-plenty; thought they were going
to be plumb paralyzed.”</p>

<p>“I want to meet that man Smith,” said the
expert, going off at a tangent, as his habit was.
“Stillings, your friend the lawyer who has his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>offices next door to my laboratory, says he’s a
wonder.”</p>

<p>“Smith is all right,” was Starbuck’s verdict.
“He’s a first-class fighting man, and he doesn’t care
much who knows it. He got big rich out of that
High Line fight, married old Colonel Baldwin’s
little peach of a daughter, and is layin’ off to live
happy ever afterward.”</p>

<p>From that on, the rear platform talk had to
do chiefly with Mr. J. Montague Smith and
his plucky struggle with the hydro-electric trust
which had tried, unsuccessfully as the event
proved, to steal the High Line dam and water
privilege. In due time the train shot out of the
gorge, and after a dodging course among the Park
hills, came to the skirting of the High Line reservoir
lake lying like a silver mirror in its setting
of forested buttes and spurs.</p>

<p>At the lower end of the lake, where the white
concrete dam stretched its massive rampart across
the river gorge, the train halted for a moment in
obedience to an interposing block-signal. It was
during the momentary stop that a handsome
young fellow with the healthy tan of the hill
country browning his frank, boyish face, came out
of the near-by power-house, ran up the embankment
and swung himself over the railing of the
observation platform.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span></p>

<p>“Hello, John!” said Starbuck; and then he introduced
the new-comer to his companion.</p>

<p>“Glad to know you, Mr. Sprague,” said the
young man, whose hearty hand-grip was an instant
recommendation to the good graces of the
big expert. “I’ve been hearing of you off and on
all summer. It’s a saying with us out here that
any friend of Dick Maxwell’s owns Brewster&mdash;or
as much of it as he cares to make use of.”</p>

<p>“I have certainly been finding it that way,
Mr. Smith,” Sprague rejoined, in grateful recognition
of the Brewster hospitality. And then:
“We were just talking about you and your dam
as we came along, Starbuck and I. You have a
pretty good head of water on, haven’t you?”</p>

<p>“An unusually good head for this time of the
year. The heavy storms we have been having in
the eastern foot-hills account for it. Our power
plant is working at normal load, and our ranchmen
are all using water liberally in their late irrigating,
and yet you see the quantity that is going over
the splash-boards.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I see,” observed Sprague thoughtfully.
And when the train began to move onward:
“With this big reservoir behind you, I suppose
a sudden flood couldn’t hurt you, Mr. Smith?”</p>

<p>The young man with the healthy tan on his clean-cut
face promptly showed his good business sense.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span></p>

<p>“We think we have a comfortably safe installation,
but we are not specially anxious to try it out
merely for the satisfaction of seeing how much it
would stand,” was the conservative reply.</p>

<p>Sprague looked up curiously from his solid
planting in the biggest of the platform folding-chairs.</p>

<p>“And yet, three days ago, Mr. Smith, you said,
in the presence of witnesses, that a ten-foot rise
wouldn’t endanger your dam or your power plant,”
he put in shrewdly.</p>

<p>Mr. J. Montague Smith, secretary and treasurer
of the Timanyoni High Line Company, was
plainly taken unawares.</p>

<p>“How the dev&mdash;” he began; and then he tried
again. “Pardon me, Mr. Sprague; you hit me
when I wasn’t looking for it. I believe I did say
something like that; in fact, I’ve said similar
things a good many times.”</p>

<p>“But not in exact feet and inches, I hope,” said
Sprague, with a show of mild concern. “These
exactnesses are what murder us, Mr. Smith. Now,
I presume if somebody should come to you to-day
and threaten to turn another ten feet of river on
you, you’d object, wouldn’t you?”</p>

<p>“We certainly should&mdash;object most strenuously!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span></p>

<p>“Yet, if that person were so minded, he might
quote you as having said that ten additional feet
wouldn’t hurt you.”</p>

<p>The young treasurer laughed a trifle uneasily.</p>

<p>“I can’t believe that anybody would make a
bit of well-meant boasting like that an excuse for&mdash;but
it’s altogether absurd, you know. Your
case is unsupposable. Nobody pushes the button
for the rains or the cloud-burst storms. When
you introduce me to the fellow who really has the
making of the weather in the Timanyoni head-waters,
I’ll be very careful what I say to him.”</p>

<p>“Just so,” said the expert quietly; and then a
long-continued blast of the locomotive whistle
announced the approach to Brewster.</p>

<p>Sprague took leave of his latest acquaintance at
the station entrance, where a trim, high-powered
motor-car, driven by an exceedingly pretty young
woman in leather cap, gauntlets, and driving-coat,
was waiting for Smith.</p>

<p>“I am a soil expert, as you may have heard,
Mr. Smith,” he said at parting, “and I am interested
at the moment in alluvial washes&mdash;the detritus
brought down from the high lands by the
rivers. One of these days I may call upon you
for a little information and help.”</p>

<p>“Command me,” said the young financier, with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>another of the hearty hand-grips; and then he
climbed in beside the pretty young woman and
was driven away.</p>

<p>Sprague was unusually silent during the tardy
luncheon shared with Starbuck in the Topaz café;
and Starbuck, who never had much to say unless
he was pointedly invited, was correspondingly
speechless. Afterward, with a word of caution
to his table companion not to mention the morning’s
adventure to any one, Sprague went to his
laboratory, to test the specimens of soil gathered
on the Mesquite mesa, Starbuck supposed.</p>

<p>But the supposition was wrong. What Mr.
Calvin Sprague busied himself with during the
afternoon was the careful developing of the film
taken from his pocket camera, and the printing
of several sets of pictures therefrom. These prints
he placed in his pocket note-book, and the book
and its enclosures went with him when, after the
evening meal, at which he had somehow missed
both Maxwell and Starbuck, he climbed the three
flights of stairs in the Tribune Building and presented
himself at the door of Editor Kendall’s
den.</p>

<p>Kendall was glad to see him, or at least he
said he was, and, waving him to a chair at the
desk end, produced a box of rather dubious-looking,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>curiously twisted cigars, at which the
visitor shook his head despondently.</p>

<p>“You’d say I was the picture of health, wouldn’t
you, Kendall, and you wouldn’t believe me if I
were to tell you that I am smoking a great deal
too much?” he said, with a quizzical smile that
was on the verge of turning into a grin.</p>

<p>The editor was not fooled; as a matter of fact,
it was an exceedingly difficult matter to fool the
tired-eyed tyrant of <i>The Tribune</i> editorial rooms.</p>

<p>“Cut it out,” he said, with his mirthless laugh.
“You wouldn’t expect to find fifty-cent <i>Rienas</i>
in a newspaper shop&mdash;any more than I’d expect
you to climb up here with a news story for me.
Smoke your own cigars, and be damned to you.”
And in sheer defiance he lighted one of his own
dubious monstrosities, while Sprague was chuckling
and passing his pocket-case of fat black <i>Maduros</i>.</p>

<p>“You say, any more than you’d expect a news
story. Perhaps I have a news story for you. Cast
your eye over these,” and he threw out the bunch
of lately made photographs.</p>

<p>The editor went over the collection carefully,
and at the end of the inspection said, “Well,
what’s the answer?”</p>

<p>“The construction camp of the Mesquite Land
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>and Irrigation Company at about half-past ten
this forenoon. The held-up man is Mr. Engineer
Jennings, posed by Billy Starbuck, who was kindly
holding a gun on him for me. The people running
are Jennings’s workmen, coming to help him obliterate
us. The water is the irrigation lake; the
heap of dirt is the dam.”</p>

<p>“Still, I don’t quite grasp the news value,” said
Kendall doubtfully. “Why should Jennings wish
to obliterate you?”</p>

<p>“Because I was taking pictures on his job. He
was unreasonable enough to demand my camera,
and to make the sham bad man’s break of handling
his gun without pulling it on me.”</p>

<p>The editor studied the pictures long and thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“You’ve got something up your sleeve, Mr.
Sprague; what is it?” he asked, after the considering
pause.</p>

<p>Sprague drew his chair closer; and for five
minutes the city editor, who had come in for a
word with his superior, forbore to break in upon
the low-toned earnest conference which was going
on at the managing editor’s desk. At the end of
it, however, he heard Kendall say, “I’ll get Monty
Smith on the wire, and if he coincides with you,
we’ll take a hand in this. I more than half believe
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>you’re right, but you’ll admit that it sounds rather
incredible. <i>The Tribune’s</i> motto is ‘All the news
that is news,’ but we don’t want to be classed
among the ‘yellows.’”</p>

<p>“You run no risk in the present instance,” was
Sprague’s confident assurance. “Of course, there
is no direct evidence; if there were, the case would
be promptly taken to the courts. As a matter of
fact, I’m hoping that Mr. Smith will take it to the
courts as it stands. But in any event, an appeal
to the public will do no harm.”</p>

<p>“All right; we’ll see what Smith says,” said Kendall;
and then the patient city editor had his inning.</p>

<p>Leaving the Tribune Building, the chemistry
expert went to the nearest telephone and called
for the house number of Mr. Robert Stillings,
the attorney who served locally for the railroad
company and was also counsel for the High Line
people. Happily, it was the young lawyer himself
who answered the ’phone.</p>

<p>“This is Sprague,” said the down-town caller.
“How busy are you this evening?”</p>

<p>The answer was apparently satisfactory, since
the big man went on: “All right; I wish you would
arrange to meet me in the lobby of the Topaz.
Catch the next car if it won’t hurry you too much.
You’ll do it? Thank you. Good-by.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span></p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later the Government man,
writing a letter at one of the desks in the hotel
lobby, looked up to greet his summoned visitor,
a keen-eyed, self-contained young man whose reputation
as a fearless fighter in just causes was
already spreading from the little inter-mountain
city of his adoption and becoming State-wide.</p>

<p>“I’m here,” said Stillings briefly; and Sprague
rose and drew him aside into one of the alcoves.</p>

<p>For some little time after they had drawn their
chairs together, Sprague held the floor, talking
earnestly and exhibiting a set of the snap-shot
pictures. Stillings listened attentively, examining
the pictures by the aid of a small pocket magnifier.
But when Sprague finished he was shaking his
head doubtfully, unconsciously following the example
set by <i>The Tribune</i> editor.</p>

<p>“We have nothing definite to go on, Mr.
Sprague, as you yourself admit. These people
are well within their legal rights. As you probably
know, there is no statutory provision in this
State requiring the builders of a dam to conform
to any particular plan of construction; and, as a
matter of fact, there are dozens of dams just like
this one&mdash;mere earth embankments without masonry
of any kind.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say that the safety of the entire
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>Timanyoni Valley can be endangered by a
structure like this, and that the property owners
who are imperilled have no legal recourse?” demanded
the expert.</p>

<p>“Recourse, yes; plenty of it after the fact. If
the dam should give way and cause damage, the
irrigation company would be liable.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” snorted the big-bodied one, half-contemptuously.
“Law is one of the few things
that I have never dabbled in. What you say
amounts to this: if I find a man training a cannon
on my house, I have no right to stop him; I can
only try to collect damages after the gun has gone
off and ripped a hole through my property. I
could make a better law than that myself!”</p>

<p>Stillings was staring thoughtfully through the
opposite window at the lights in the railroad building
across the plaza.</p>

<p>“There are times, Mr. Sprague, when we all feel
that way; crises which seem to call for something
in the way of extra-judicial proceedings,” he admitted.
And then: “Have you told Maxwell
about this?”</p>

<p>“Not specifically. Dick has troubles of his
own just now; he has had enough of them this
summer to turn his hair gray, as you know. I
have been hoping that this latest move of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>enemy could be blocked without dragging him
into it.”</p>

<p>Stillings turned quickly. “That is the frankest
thing you’ve said this evening. Is it another move
of the enemy&mdash;the New Yorkers?”</p>

<p>Sprague spread his hands and his big shoulders
went up in a shrug.</p>

<p>“You have just as much incriminating evidence
as I have. How does it strike you?”</p>

<p>The attorney shook his head in doubtful incredulity,
again unconsciously following Editor
Kendall’s lead.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t seem possible!” he protested.
“Think of the tremendous consequences involved&mdash;outside
of the crippling of the railroad. The
Short Line wouldn’t be the only sufferer in case
of a dam-break in the Mesquite. The entire valley
would be flood-swept, and our High Line
dam&mdash;” he stopped abruptly and half-rose to his
feet. “Good Lord, Sprague! the breaking of the
High Line dam would mean death and destruction
without end!”</p>

<p>Sprague had found a cigar in an overlooked
pocket and was calmly lighting it. Though he
did not tell Stillings so, the argument had finally
gotten around into the field toward which he had
been pushing it from the first.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span></p>

<p>“Three days ago, your High Line treasurer,
Mr. J. Montague Smith, declared in the presence
of witnesses&mdash;it was right here in this hotel lobby,
and I happened to overhear it&mdash;that a ten-foot
rise in the river, which, as you know, would submerge
and sweep away miles of the railroad track
in the canyon, would by no means endanger his
dam. There you are, Mr. Stillings. Now fish
or cut bait.”</p>

<p>“Great Scott! what could Smith have been
thinking of!” ejaculated the lawyer.</p>

<p>“It was merely a bit of loyal brag, as he admitted
to Starbuck and me on the train this afternoon;
and it had been craftily provoked by one of
the men who heard it. But he said it, and what is
more, he said it to&mdash;Jennings!”</p>

<p>This time the attorney’s start carried him out
of his chair and stood him upon his feet.</p>

<p>“I shall have to see Smith at once,” he said
hurriedly. “Still, I can’t believe that these New
York stock pirates would authorize any such murderous
thing as this!”</p>

<p>“Authorize murder or violence? Of course not;
big business never does that. What it does is
to put a man into the field, telling him in general
terms the end that is to be accomplished.
The head pushers would turn blue under their
finger-nails if you’d charge them with murder.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span></p>

<p>“But that is what this would amount to&mdash;cold-blooded
murder!”</p>

<p>“Hold on a minute,” objected Sprague. “Let’s
apply a little scientific reasoning. Suppose this
thing has been accurately figured out, engineering-wise.
Suppose that, by careful computation,
it has been found that a certain quantity of water,
turned loose at the mouth of Mesquite Valley,
would produce a flood of a certain height in the full
length of Timanyoni Canyon&mdash;say ten or twelve
feet&mdash;sufficient to obliterate thirty-five or forty
miles of the railroad track. Below its path of
the greatest destruction it comes out into your
High Line reservoir lake, with some miles farther
to go, and a greatly enlarged area over which to
diffuse itself.”</p>

<p>Stillings was nodding intelligence. “I am beginning
to see,” he said. “Ten feet in the canyon
wouldn’t necessarily mean ten feet at Smith’s
dam.”</p>

<p>“No; but at the same time Smith is on record
as having said that ten feet wouldn’t endanger his
dam or the power plant. So there you are again.”</p>

<p>Stillings walked the length of the alcove twice
with his head down and his hands in his pockets
before he stopped in front of the expert to say:
“You’ve half-convinced me, Mr. Sprague. If we
could get the barest shred of evidence that these
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>people are building a dam which isn’t intended to
hold&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“There spoke the lawyer again,” laughed
Sprague. “If you had the evidence, what would
you do?”</p>

<p>“Institute legal proceedings at once.”</p>

<p>“And how long would it take you to get action?”</p>

<p>“Oh, that would depend upon the nature of the
evidence I had to offer, of course.”</p>

<p>Sprague laughed again, derisively this time.</p>

<p>“Yes, I thought so; and while you were getting
out your writs and monkeying around&mdash;do you
know what that piece of canyon track cost, Mr.
Stillings? I was told to-day that three million
dollars wouldn’t replace it&mdash;to say nothing of what
it would mean to the railroad company to have its
through line put out of business indefinitely. No;
if we mean to&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The interruption was the intrusion into the alcove
of a huge-framed, hard-faced man who was
fumbling in his pocket for a paper.</p>

<p>“Hello, Harding,” said Stillings; and then,
jokingly: “What brings the respected sheriff of
Timanyoni County charging in upon us at this
time of night?”</p>

<p>“It’s a warrant,” said the sheriff, half in apology.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span>And then to Sprague: “I hate like the mischief
to trouble you, Mr. Sprague, but duty’s
duty.”</p>

<p>Sprague smiled up at the big man. “Tell us
about it, Mr. Harding. You needn’t bother to
read the warrant.”</p>

<p>“It’s that scrap you had with Jennings up at the
Mesquite this morning. He’s swore out a warrant
against you for assault and battery.”</p>

<p>“And are you going to lock me up over night?
I fancy that is what he would like to have you
do.”</p>

<p>“Not me,” said the sheriff good-naturedly.
“I got Judge MacFarland out o’ bed and made him
come down to his office. I’m goin’ to ask you to
walk around there with me, just to let me out of it
whole. I’ve fixed it with the judge so you won’t
have to give bail.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go with you,” Stillings offered; and a
few minutes later, in the magistrate’s office, the
Government man had bound himself on his own
recognizance to appear in court the next morning
to answer the charge against him.</p>

<p>On the sidewalk in front of the justice shop,
Stillings reverted to the more pressing matter.</p>

<p>“I’m going to see Smith before I sleep, if I have
to drive out to the Baldwin ranch to find him,” he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span>declared. “In the meantime, Mr. Sprague, if you
can devise any scheme by which we can get a legal
hold on these fellows&mdash;anything that will serve as
an excuse for our asking that an injunction be
issued&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That would come before Judge Watson,
wouldn’t it?” Sprague broke in.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“See Kendall, of <i>The Tribune</i>, about that.
From what he told me a couple of hours ago, I
should say that your petition for an injunction
would be only a crude loss of time. We’ll try
to think of a better way, or at least a more effective
way. Good-night; and don’t omit to throw
the gaff into Smith, good and hard.”</p>

<p>On the morning following Sprague’s visit to <i>The
Tribune</i> editorial rooms, the newspaper-reading
public of Brewster had a small sensation served, in
Starbuck’s phrase, “hot from the skillet.” A
good portion of the front page of <i>The Tribune</i> was
given to a news story of the work which was under
way in the Mesquite Valley, and pictures were
printed of the camp, the dam, and the growing
lake.</p>

<p>On the editorial page there was a caustic arraignment
of the Mesquite Company, which was
called upon to show cause why it should not be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>condemned as a public nuisance of a kind which
had already brought much reproach upon the West
as a field for legitimate investment, and the suggestion
was made that a committee of responsible
citizens be sent to investigate the Mesquite project,
to the end that the charges made might be
either substantiated or set aside.</p>

<p>Specifically, these charges were that there was
no arable land within reach of the Mesquite dam,
and that the dam itself was unsafe. Throughout
his editorial Kendall had judiciously refrained
from making any mention of a possible disaster
to the railroad; but he hinted broadly at the danger
to which the High Line dam&mdash;the source of the
city’s power and lights&mdash;would be subjected in
the event of a flood catastrophe on the distant
project.</p>

<p>Maxwell, who was living at the hotel in the absence
of his family, had read the paper before he
came down to join Sprague at the breakfast-table,
and, like every other newspaper reader in Brewster
that morning, he was full of the latest sensation.</p>

<p>“By George, Calvin,” he began, “somebody has
been stirring up the mud for those people we were
talking about night before last. Have you seen
<i>The Tribune</i>?”</p>

<p>Sprague nodded assent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span></p>

<p>“What do you make of it?” asked the railroad
man.</p>

<p>“I should say that somebody&mdash;possibly the
High Line management&mdash;is beginning to sit up
and take notice, wouldn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Y-yes; but see here&mdash;any such thing as Kendall
hints at would knock the Nevada Short Line
out long before it would get to the High Line
dam!”</p>

<p>“Naturally,” said Sprague coolly.</p>

<p>“Great Jehu! was that what you meant when
you were making me dig this Mesquite project
over for you the other day?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t want to drag you into it, and don’t
yet,” said Sprague quietly. “You’ve had grief
enough for one summer. But the detective half
of me tells me that there is little doubt that this
thing is another attempt on the part of the big-money
crowd to side-swipe your railroad off the
map. It can be done, and you have no preventive
recourse; Stillings says you haven’t.”</p>

<p>“But, Calvin&mdash;something’s <i>got</i> to be done! Are
we going to sit still and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“One kind of a something is doing itself, right
now,” interrupted Sprague. “It’s your play, this
time, to keep out of it, if you can. You’d say that
the High Line people, J. Montague Smith and his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>crowd, inspired that blast in <i>The Tribune</i> this
morning, wouldn’t you?”</p>

<p>“It looks that way, yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, let them stir up the mud and make the
fight. You sit tight in the boat and say nothing.
What kind of an agent or operator have you at
Angels?”</p>

<p>“Disbrow?&mdash;he’s a good man; so good that I’m
going to promote him to a better station next
week.”</p>

<p>“Let that promotion wait a while. Give this
good man instructions to watch every move that
Jennings makes, and to report at once anything
out of the ordinary that may happen. Do you
get that?”</p>

<p>“I’ll do it. Anything else?”</p>

<p>“No, not at present. Later on, say after the
evening edition of <i>The Times-Record</i> comes out,
I may want to get you on a quick wire. But the
chief thing just now is to post the Angels man, and
to have him keep in touch with you.”</p>

<p>After Maxwell had gone the chemistry expert
finished his breakfast with epicurean leisure,
smoked a reflective cigar in comfortable solitude
in the hotel lobby, and, when the court hour arrived,
went around to the office of the justice of
the peace to answer to the charge of assault. As
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>was to be expected, Jennings was not present; was
not even represented by an attorney. Sprague
pleaded guilty and paid his nominal fine, which
MacFarland took with a quiet smile.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you did to that black-faced
bully, Mr. Sprague, but I hope you got your
money’s worth,” he said. “Every time he turns
up here in Brewster he proves himself an undesirable
citizen, right from the word go.”</p>

<p>“Tough, is he?” queried Sprague.</p>

<p>“As tough as they make them. I wonder he
didn’t try to get square with you with a gun.
That would be more like him.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he will, later on,” suggested the fined
one, with a good-natured smile; after which he
went across to his laboratory and was invisible
for the remainder of the morning.</p>

<p>Just before noon Stillings dropped into the
laboratory office. He found the chemist working
among his retorts and test-tubes.</p>

<p>“I fell in to give you a pointer,” was the attorney’s
excuse for the intrusion. “Jennings is in
town. He came over on the ten-o’clock local
and went straight to <i>The Times-Record</i> office.”</p>

<p>Sprague grinned. “You were looking out for
him, were you? Somebody got waked up at
last?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span></p>

<p>“Yes; the High Line people are on, all right,”
was the reply. “Smith called an emergency meeting
of his directors early this morning. Two of
them are Red Desert cattle barons, and they know
the Mesquite situation like a book. What none
of them can understand is the ‘why’; why the
Mesquite outfit should take ninety-nine chances in
a hundred of sending a flood down the Timanyoni
when there is no money to be made by it.”</p>

<p>“What action did the directors’ meeting take?”</p>

<p>“Instructed me to feel Judge Watson on the
question of holding things up with an injunction.
I did it, and it turned out as you intimated it
would; nothing doing. Smith asked me to borrow
Maxwell’s special officer, Arch Tarbell, suggesting
that we ought to keep in touch with Jennings.
Archer was going over to Angels on the
afternoon train, but Jennings has saved him the
trouble by coming to town.”</p>

<p>“Well, what next?” Sprague inquired.</p>

<p>“That is just what I’d like to ask you,” was the
lawyer’s frank admission. “We’re all looking to
you to set the pace. You’re the one man with the
holy gift of initiative, Mr. Sprague. You haven’t
admitted it in so many words, but I know as well
as I know anything that you are the man who
started this newspaper talk.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span></p>

<p>“Pshaw!” said the expert, in genial raillery;
“I’m only a Government chemist, Mr. Stillings.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right, too; but that isn’t why the
railroad men call you ‘Scientific Sprague.’ Four
times this summer you’ve dug Maxwell and his
railroad out of a hole when the rest of us didn’t
know there was any hole. What I’m most afraid
of now is that Jennings will put up some sort of
a scheme to get you out of the way. He knows
well enough by this time that you are the key to
his situation.”</p>

<p>“I’m a tenderfoot,” said the big man, with
naïve irony. “What would you suggest?”</p>

<p>“That you go to Sheriff Harding and get him to
swear you in as a special deputy. Then you can
be prepared to defend yourself.”</p>

<p>Sprague’s mellow laugh rumbled deep in his big
body.</p>

<p>“I guess I can take care of myself, if it comes to
that, without ‘packing hardware,’ as Starbuck
would put it,” he averred. “There won’t be more
than three or four of them to tackle me at once,
will there? But about your campaign&mdash;I have
been hoping that the High Line people, backed
by public sentiment, would be able to head this
thing off. I am still hoping it. It will be altogether
better if the railroad doesn’t have to take a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span>hand on its own account. The New Yorkers
would be sure to make capital out of it, holding
the Ford-Maxwell management up to public
execration as a corporation which deliberately
strangles development propositions in its own
territory.”</p>

<p>“That’s a fact,” the attorney agreed.</p>

<p>“Working along that line, we can afford to wait,
for a little while at least, to see how the cat is
going to jump. Jennings is over here to get
into the newspaper fight himself. In Maxwell’s
demoralization tussle of two weeks ago, it was
demonstrated that <i>The Times-Record</i> had been
subsidized by the enemy. Now we shall see Higginson
and his editor jump in and take up the
clubs in defence of the Mesquite Company.”</p>

<p>“I guess that is pretty good advice&mdash;to wait,”
said Stillings. “But we have an active crowd in
the High Line, and its blood is up. Our people
will want to be doing something while they
wait.”</p>

<p>“Let them talk,” said Sprague quickly. “Tell
them to resolve themselves into committees of one
to throw the big scare into the Brewster public
which depends upon the safety of the High Line
dam for its own safety. Then pick out a few good,
dependable men like Smith, his old fighting father-in-law
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>the colonel, and Williams the engineer,
who will hold themselves in readiness to start at a
moment’s notice, night or day, for the firing line&mdash;any
firing line that may happen to show up.”</p>

<p>“That is more like it,” rejoined the attorney.
“I’m sworn to uphold the majesty of the law,
but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But, as you remarked last night, there are
extra-judicial crises now and then which have to
be met in any old way that offers. Let it rest at
that, and see me at the hotel this evening, if you
can make it convenient.”</p>

<p>With the appearance on the streets of the evening
edition of <i>The Times-Record</i>, the Brewster
public learned that there were two sides to the
Mesquite question. In terms of unmeasured
scorn Editor Healy attacked the narrow prejudice
which would seek to place stumbling-blocks in
the way of a great enterprise designed to benefit,
not only the region locally concerned, but the
entire West.</p>

<p>In the course of a long and vituperative editorial,
the High Line company, the Brewster
public-service corporations, and the railroad, each
came in for its share of accusation, and their joint
lack of public spirit was roundly condemned. It
was pointed out that the High Line plant, by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span>the admission of its own officials, would be in no
danger even in the unsupposable case of the breaking
of the Mesquite dam. Also, it was urged that
the penny-wise policy of the railroad in adopting
the low grade in Timanyoni Canyon was a matter
of its own risk. Was the development of the nation
to be halted, it was asked, because a niggardly
railroad company was unwilling to spend a little
money in raising its grade beyond a possible danger
line?</p>

<p>But the sting of the editorial for Maxwell was
in its tail. Healy concluded by darkly hinting
that certain of the railroad officials were interested
financially in sundry Timanyoni Park lands owned
by the High Line Company, and that they were
willing to kill the prospects of the new district
for the sake of their own pockets.</p>

<p>Maxwell was furiously hot about this blast in
the evening paper, as his demeanor at the dinner-table,
where he spoke his mind freely to Sprague,
sufficiently proved.</p>

<p>“Why, the miserable liars!” he raged. “There
isn’t an official on the Short Line from President
Ford down who owns a single share of stock in the
High Line! We all did help out at first, but Ford
made every man of us turn loose the minute the
dam was completed and the project was securely
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span>on its feet. He insisted that we couldn’t afford
to work for two dividend accounts!”</p>

<p>“He was quite right,” said Sprague calmly.
“But that is neither here nor there. It was
Jennings’s turn at bat and he took it. Let it go,
and tell me what you hear from that good and
reliable man, Disbrow, at Angels.”</p>

<p>“I had him on the wire myself, just a few minutes
ago,” was the superintendent’s answer. “He
says something has stirred things up over on the
Mesquite. They’re working night shifts&mdash;began
last night.”</p>

<p>“Rain?” queried the expert.</p>

<p>“How the devil do you manage to jump at
things that way?” demanded Maxwell, half-irritably.
“Yes; there have been cloud-bursts in
the eastern foot-hills. The river rose two feet
to-day.”</p>

<p>“Ah? That may bring on more talk&mdash;before
the stenographers are ready to take it down. Any
more items from Angels?”</p>

<p>“Nothing special. The Mesquite people got
half a car-load of dynamite this morning. That
shows you how careful Disbrow is; he is spotting
everything&mdash;even the common routine things.”</p>

<p>“Um; dynamite, eh? What use has Jennings
for so much high explosive as that?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t know; uses it in excavating, I suppose.
The more he uses, the bigger his rake-off from the
powder company. Where there’s a big graft,
there are always a lot of little ones.”</p>

<p>Sprague ate in silence for five full minutes before
he said, quite without preliminary: “How long
would it take a light special train to run from Brewster
to Angels, with a clear track and regardless
orders, Dick?”</p>

<p>“I made it once in my own car in two hours and
fifty-five minutes, with two stops for water.
Why?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I was just curious to know. Two fifty-five,
eh? And how long would it take to get the
special train ready?”</p>

<p>“Fifteen or twenty minutes, perhaps, on a rush
order.”</p>

<p>Sprague sat back and began to fold his napkin
carefully in the original creases.</p>

<p>“As I have said before, I don’t want to pose as
an alarmist, Maxwell; but if I were you, I’d have
that special train hooked up and ready to pull out&mdash;and
I’d keep it that way, on tap, so to speak.”</p>

<p>The railroad man rose to the occasion promptly.</p>

<p>“Beginning to-night?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, beginning to-night.”</p>

<p>“Has Jennings gone back?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span></p>

<p>“He has. He went over on the evening train.
Your man Tarbell kept cases on him while he was
here. He spent most of the day with Higginson
and Healy in <i>The Times-Record</i> office.”</p>

<p>Maxwell refused his dessert and ordered a
second cup of black coffee.</p>

<p>“This suspense is something fierce, Calvin,” he
said, when the waiter left them. “Have we got
to sit still and do nothing?”</p>

<p>“That is your part in it,” was the quiet reply.
“If a party of prominent citizens should call upon
you for a special train at some odd hour of the day
or night, you want to be ready to supply it suddenly.
Aside from that, you are to keep hands
off.”</p>

<p>For forty-eight hours beyond this evening dinner
in the Topaz café&mdash;two days during which the
railroad agent at Angels reported increased activities
at the Mesquite dam&mdash;the newspaper
wrangle over the merits and demerits of the irrigation
project in the edge of the Red Desert went
on with growing acrimony on both sides. But
by the end of the second day it was apparent that
<i>The Tribune</i> had public sentiment with it almost
unanimously.</p>

<p>It was also on this second day that further bitterness
was engendered by a street report that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>Judge Watson had enjoined the High Line Company
from interfering in any way with the operations
on the Mesquite. This was the last straw,
and public indignation found expression that night
in a monster mass meeting of protest, in which the
speakers, with J. Montague Smith to set them the
example, criticised the court sharply in free
Western phrase.</p>

<p>After the meeting, adopting all sorts of resolutions
condemnatory of everything in sight, adjourned&mdash;which
was between nine and ten o’clock&mdash;there
was a street rumor to the effect that
Judge Watson would declare some of the speakers
in contempt, and cinch them accordingly.</p>

<p>Maxwell and Starbuck brought this report to
Sprague, who was smoking one of his big, black
cigars on the porch of the hotel.</p>

<p>“Going to institute contempt proceedings, is
he?” said the expert, with interest apparently only
half-aroused.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t that jar you?” commented Starbuck.
“I was telling Dick just now that Judge
Watson has about outlived his usefulness in this
little old shack town. This injunction of his is
about the rawest thing that ever came over the
range.”</p>

<p>“Smith is red-hot,” Maxwell put in; “hot
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>enough to get out and scrap somebody. And his
directors are all with him.”</p>

<p>Still the big-bodied expert seemed only mildly
interested.</p>

<p>“If anybody should happen to get mixed up
legally with the Mesquite folks on this job of
theirs, it would be pretty hard to get a jury in
Brewster which would lean the way the judge
does, wouldn’t it?” he asked.</p>

<p>Maxwell’s verdict was unqualified. “It would
be practically impossible.” He had found his
pipe and was filling it when Sprague pointed to
the spur track at the end of the railroad building
opposite.</p>

<p>“Is that your special train over there, Dick?”</p>

<p>“Yes. You see I’ve obeyed orders. That
train has been standing there for two days, with
three shifts of men dividing up the watch in the
engine cab.”</p>

<p>“And the committee of prominent citizens
hasn’t yet materialized, eh? Never mind; you’ve
done your part. What is the latest from Angels?”</p>

<p>“More cloud-bursts in the hills, and more
activity up on the Mesquite. Disbrow says that
Jennings has been offering all sorts of big pay to
the scattered ranchmen to get them to come on
the job with scraper-teams.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span></p>

<p>“That’s bad,” said the chemistry man briefly;
adding, “I don’t like that.”</p>

<p>Starbuck got up to stand with his back to a
porch pillar. From the new position he could
look through the windows into the thronged hotel
lobby.</p>

<p>“This town’s stirred up some hotter than I’ve
ever seen it before,” he drawled. “Look at that
mob inside&mdash;and every blame’ man of it chewing
the rag over this water proposition.”</p>

<p>“I don’t like that,” Sprague repeated, thus
proving that he had entirely missed Starbuck’s
comment on the excitement. Then he sat up suddenly.
“There’s a boy just coming down from
your offices, Maxwell; it’s the night watchman’s
boy, isn’t it? Run across and head him, Starbuck;
I believe that’s a telegram he has in his hand.”</p>

<p>Starbuck swung himself over the railing and
caught the lad before he could disappear in the
street throngs.</p>

<p>“You were plumb right,” he said, when he came
back to take his place on the porch. “He did have
a message; it’s for Dick. Here you are.”</p>

<p>Maxwell tore the envelope across and held the
telegram up to the ceiling light.</p>

<p>“Here’s news,” he announced. “It’s from our
man at Angels. He says: ‘Jennings’s force disbanded,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span>and most of it gone east on Limited.
Been shipping teams and outfit all afternoon. Too
busy to wire sooner.’” The superintendent crumpled
the telegram and smote fist into palm.
“Bully for you, Sprague!” he exulted. “You
pushed the right button just right! Jennings
couldn’t stand the pressure; he’s given up the job
and quit!”</p>

<p>There was no answering enthusiasm on the part
of the big man who rose suddenly out of his chair
and reached for the telegram. Quite the contrary,
the hand which took the crumpled bit of paper was
trembling a little.</p>

<p>“Dick,” he began, in his deepest chest tone,
“you hike over to the despatcher’s office on the
dead run and have Connolly clear for that special
train. Don’t lose a minute! Starbuck, it’s up to
you to find Smith, Tarbell, Williams, Colonel
Baldwin, and two or three more good men whom
you can trust&mdash;trust absolutely, mind you. Herd
your crowd at the station in the quickest possible
time; and you, Maxwell, make it your first business
to tell the agent at Angels that there is a
special train coming over the road. Don’t tell
him its destination; just say it will leave Brewster,
going east, in a few minutes. Don’t slip up on
that&mdash;it may mean a dozen human lives! Get
busy, both of you!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span></p>

<p>After he was left alone, Sprague shouldered a
path through the crowd in the lobby and had himself
lifted to his rooms. When he came down a
few minutes later he had changed his business
clothes for the field rig which he wore on his soil-collecting
expeditions. He had scarcely worked
his way through the throng to the comparative
freedom of the porch when Maxwell came hurrying
across from the railroad building.</p>

<p>“Bad luck,” said the superintendent, with
brittle emphasis. “There’s a freight-train off the
steel half-way between Corona and Timanyoni,
this side of the canyon, and the track is blocked.”</p>

<p>“And we can’t get by? There is nothing on
the other side of the wreck that you could order
down to meet us at the block?”</p>

<p>“Nothing nearer than Angels. There is an
eastbound freight held there, loading the last of
Jennings’s outfit. To order the engine back from
that would add at least an hour and a half to the
two-hour-and-fifty-minute running schedule I gave
you the other day.”</p>

<p>Sprague swore out of a full heart, which, since
he was the least profane of men, was an accurate
measure of his growing disquietude.</p>

<p>“That’s on me!” he grated. “I had it all
figured out to the tenth decimal place, <i>and I didn’t
put in the factor of chance</i>! Dick, I want the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span>biggest automobile in this town, and the one man
among all your thousands who is least afraid to
drive it.”</p>

<p>Maxwell was able to answer without hesitation.
“The car will be Colonel Baldwin’s big ‘six,’ with
Starbuck for your reckless chauffeur. But I doubt
if you can get over the range in anything that goes
on wheels.” Then he added: “What is it, Calvin?
What have you figured out?”</p>

<p>Sprague ignored the anxious query and spoke
only to the fact.</p>

<p>“Can’t get over the range? I tell you, we’ve
got to get over the range! Good Lord! why in
Heaven’s name doesn’t Starbuck hurry?”</p>

<p>Starbuck had hurried. He had looked to find
most, if not all, of the men he had been told to
summon, closeted in conference with Stillings, and
his guess had gone true to the mark. Only Tarbell
was missing, and him they picked up in front
of <i>The Tribune</i> office as they were hurrying to the
rendezvous in the colonel’s big touring-car.</p>

<p>Maxwell saw the car as it came under the corner
electrics. “There’s a little luck, anyway!” he
exclaimed. “That is the Colonel’s car, now, and
Billy is driving it.”</p>

<p>“Tools and arms; half a dozen picks and shovels,
and anything you can find that will shoot,” commanded
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span>Sprague, vaulting the porch railing to the
sidewalk as easily as Starbuck had vaulted it a
little while before. “See to that part of the outfit
yourself, Dick, while I’m looking after the human
end of it.”</p>

<p>One minute afterward the big man was standing
beside the touring-car which had been drawn up at
the town-side platform of the railroad building.
Sprague shot the emergency at the five men in the
car in bullet-like sentences.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen, we’ve got to get over to the Mesquite
as quick as the Lord’ll let us. The railroad
is blocked, and it’s an auto or nothing. Maxwell
says we can’t do it. I say we’ve got to do it.
What do you say?”</p>

<p>“I reckon we can do it,” drawled Starbuck,
speaking for all. Then he turned to Smith, who
was in the tonneau. “How about the tanks,
Monty?”</p>

<p>“I filled them to-night, before we left the ranch,”
said the High Line treasurer. “Also, there is an
extra gallon of oil aboard&mdash;we always carry it.”</p>

<p>“How about it, colonel?” Sprague demanded
of the erect, white-mustached old man in the back
seat.</p>

<p>“Sure!” was the quick reply. “You haven’t
told us yet whether it’s a fight or a frolic, but we’re
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span>all with you, either way, Mr. Sprague. Hop in,
and we’ll be jogging along.”</p>

<p>It was at this moment that Maxwell, followed
by a couple of yard men, came up. The men were
carrying the picks and shovels, which were hastily
stowed in the car, and the superintendent handed
over a small arsenal of weapons, three of them being
sawed-off Winchesters.</p>

<p>“I had to raid the express office,” he explained,
“and I took what I could find.” Then
to Sprague, who had mounted to the seat beside
Starbuck. “Don’t you want me along?”</p>

<p>“No; you can do a great deal more good right
here. Listen, now, and follow my directions to
the letter. Go upstairs to the wire and get in
touch with your man at Angels. It will be your
job to keep him in doubt as to what is on the road
<i>between his station and the lower end of the canyon</i>.
Lie to him if you have to; tell him a part of the
wrecked freight is on its way up the canyon, or
something of that sort, and keep him believing it
as long as you possibly can. Don’t fall down on it!
Everything depends now upon the length of time
you can keep some such story as that going over
the wires.”</p>

<p>Starbuck had adjusted a pair of goggles to his
eyes, and had his foot on the clutch-pedal. “All
set?” he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span></p>

<p>“Go!” said Sprague; and at the word the big
car shot away from the platform, rounded the end
of the plaza, and bore away through a cross street
to the eastward, gathering headway until, when
the city limits were passed, its cutout exhausts
were blending in a deafening roar.</p>

<p>Sprague was the only member of the party who
had not at some time in the past had experience
with Starbuck’s driving. But before the first ten-mile
lap on the mesa road had been covered he,
too, had had his initiation. There was a little
lamp on the dash which poured its tiny ray on the
dial of the speedometer. Sprague saw the index
pointer go up to thirty-five, jump to forty, crawl
steadily onward until it had passed the forty-five
and was mounting to the fifty. After that he
saw no more, for the simple reason that he was
obliged to close his unprotected eyes against the
hurricane speed blast. The big man from Washington
had asked for the fastest car in Brewster
and for a man who was not afraid to drive it. He
had got both.</p>

<p>At the same time, alarming as the pace might
seem, Starbuck was not taking any needless
chances. He knew his road, and knew also that
there were many miles of it among the mountains
that would have to be taken at slower speed.
None the less, when the long mesa stretch was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span>covered, and the big car was making zigzags up
the precipitous slopes of Mount Cornell to reach
the gap called Navajo Notch, the pace was still
terrific, and the sober-faced driver was leaning
over his wheel and pushing the motor like a true
speed-maniac.</p>

<p>There was an hour of this risky zigzagging, and
then the pass, lying cold and grim in the half moon-light
at altitude ten thousand feet, was reached
and threaded. Following the summit-gaining
came the down-mountain rush on the eastern
slope, and again Sprague closed his eyes, confessing
inwardly that the steadiest nerve may have
its limitations. With precipices shooting skyward
on the right, and plunging sheer to unknown
depths on the left, and with a man at the wheel
who had apparently hypnotized himself until he
had become a mere machine driving a machine&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>When Sprague opened his eyes the great car was
once more on an even keel and its wheels were
spurning the hard red sand of the desert. In the
far distance ahead a light was twinkling, the
lamp in the station office at Angels. Sprague
spoke to the iron-nerved driver at his side.</p>

<p>“Hold on, Billy; can you make the remainder
of the run without the lamps?”</p>

<p>Starbuck brought the big machine to a stand,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span>and leaned over and extinguished the lights. A
little later, under Sprague’s directions, he was
making a silent circuit of the town, with the
muffler in and the engine speeded at its quietest.</p>

<p>Since it was far past midnight, the better part
of Angels was abed and asleep, with lights showing
only at the railroad station and in Pete Grim’s
dance-hall, where, arguing from the row of hitched
horses, a round-up of Red Desert cowboys made
merry. Sprague stopped the car by a sign to
Starbuck and turned to Tarbell.</p>

<p>“Get out, Archer, and make a quick run over
to the station. I want to know what’s going on
in Disbrow’s office.”</p>

<p>Tarbell made the reconnaissance and was back
in a few minutes.</p>

<p>“Disbrow is at his wire, with a man walkin’ the
floor behind him; and there’s a piebald bronc’
hitched out beyond the freight shed,” was the
brief report.</p>

<p>“Who is the floor-walker?” asked Sprague.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t get a fair squint at him, but he
looked mightily like the fellow I been keepin’ cases
on for the last two or three days.”</p>

<p>“Gentlemen, we’re in luck, for once,” Sprague
said impressively. “That’s Jennings, without
doubt; and he is waiting for a wire&mdash;the right kind
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span>of a wire&mdash;to come from Brewster. You remember
what I told Maxwell, as we were leaving? That
was one time when a guess was as good as a
prophecy. Go on, Billy, and head straight for
the Mesquite. And you gentlemen back there,
get your weapons ready. If there happens to
be a guard at the dam, we’ll have to rush it.”</p>

<p>Singularly enough, when the short run was accomplished
they found that there was no guard.
The shack camp was deserted, with all the disorder
of a hasty evacuation strewn broadcast. But
in the valley itself there was a startling change.
The lake, which, three days earlier, had reached
only half-way up the earth embankment, was now
lapping within a foot of the dam top, the result
of the continued storms and cloud-bursts reported
by the Brewster weather station.</p>

<p>Starbuck eased the big car up to the dam head,
and Williams and Tarbell made a quick quartering
of the deserted camp. “Nobody here,” the
engineer reported, when they came back to the
car; and then Sprague asked Starbuck to relight
the head-lamps.</p>

<p>With the acetylenes flinging their broad white
beam across the earthwork, another change was
made apparent. In the centre of the dam a square
pit, plank-lined like the shaft of a mine, had been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span>either sunk or left in the building. Over this
pit stood a three-legged hoist, with the block-and-tackle
still hanging from its apex.</p>

<p>“What is that thing out there?” queried the
colonel, shading his eyes with his hand.</p>

<p>“Jennings would probably tell you that it is
a new kind of spillway, by which, in case of need,
the reservoir lake can be emptied,” suggested
Sprague. “But we haven’t time to investigate
it just now. Our job at the present moment is
to take the law into our hands and empty this
lake, and to do it, if we can, without bringing on
the catastrophe it was designed to accomplish.”</p>

<p>“Heavens!” ejaculated Colonel Baldwin.
“That’s a criminal offence, isn’t it?&mdash;and in the
face of Judge Watson’s injunction, at that!”</p>

<p>“It is criminal,” was the calm reply; “unless
we shall find sufficient justification for it as we go
along. There is one chance in a dozen that we
may find it first. Tarbell, take this little flash-light
of mine and skip out there and look into
that pit.”</p>

<p>Tarbell paused scarcely a moment at the mouth
of the mid-dam shaft. “It’s filled up to within
a few feet of the top with dirt,” he said, when he
returned.</p>

<p>“That is what I expected. We might find
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span>another warrant for what we are about to do, but
we haven’t time to search for it. Jennings may
come back at any minute, and if he suspects anything
wrong, he’ll bring that bunch of dance-hall
cowmen with him. If you’d like to hide the car
and stand aside to see what he will do when he
comes&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“By Jove! I’m with you, injunction or no injunction!”
cried Smith, and he began to take the
picks and shovels out of the car.</p>

<p>“Go to it,” said the colonel; and Sprague
turned to Williams.</p>

<p>“Mr. Williams, you’re an engineer. Our problem
is to drain this lake in the shortest possible
time in which it can be done without raising a dangerous
flood-level in the Timanyoni River. We’re
under your orders.”</p>

<p>Williams took the job as a dog snaps at a fly,
barking out his directions with the curt precision
of a man who knew his business. Planks were
brought from the dismantled shacks to be thrust
down on the inward face of the dam as a protection,
and these were weighted in place with a make shift
buttressing built out of the bags of sand which
had been used as temporary coffer-dams in the
construction work. When all was ready, a small
ditch was opened across the protected end of the
dam and the water began to pour through.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</span></p>

<p>Immediately the wisdom of Williams’s precaution
became evident. Instantly the rushing
stream began to eat into the loosely built dam,
threatening to turn the ditch into a gully and the
gully into a chasm, and quick work was necessary
with more planks and sand-bags to check the rapid
widening of the spillway. Even at that, the ditch
grew swiftly deeper and more cavernous as the
torrent emptied itself through it, and the roar of
the artificial cataract filled the air with a note of
sustained thunder.</p>

<p>“Jennings’ll be deaf if he doesn’t hear this
plumb down at the railroad!” shouted Tarbell.
But there was no time to consider the consequences
Jennings-wise. Every man of the six, including
the colonel, was constrained to work like mad to
prevent the catastrophe they were trying to avert.</p>

<p>It was when the flood was pouring through the
gap in a solid six-foot stream that shot itself far
out to fall in a thunderous deluge upon the barren
Mesquite mesa, and the planking and sand-bagging
was sufficing to hold it measurably within
bounds, that Sprague took steps looking toward
a defensive battle should the need arise. Under
his direction the auto was drawn out to one side
and the lamps were extinguished. Then a hasty
breastwork was made of the remaining bags of
sand, and Tarbell and Starbuck were sent out as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</span>skirmishers to keep watch on the Angels road while
the others renewed their efforts to hold the pouring
torrent within safe limits.</p>

<p>A toiling half-hour, during which the spillway
flood had slowly grown in volume until it threatened
to become a destroying crevasse, slipped
away, and at the end of it the two scouts came
hurrying in.</p>

<p>“They’re coming!” yelled Starbuck; and once
again the big man from the East took the command.</p>

<p>“Down behind the sand-bags!” he shouted.
“If Jennings gets near enough to strike a match
on this hill-side, we’ll all go to glory!”</p>

<p>Sprague had predicted that if Jennings suspected
trouble he would not return to the dam alone.
The prediction was verified when a squad of
mounted men came in view at the turn in the road
leading around the hill shoulder. The moon,
declining to its setting behind the Timanyonis,
flung ghostly shadows across the valley, and the
watchers behind the sand-bag breastwork saw only
the dark blot of blacker shadow sweeping up the
road.</p>

<p>“Give ’em a volley over their heads!” Sprague
ordered, and the three sawed-off Winchesters
barked spitefully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</span></p>

<p>“That means war,” said the colonel, when the
charging cavalcade stopped abruptly and a dropping
fusillade of revolver-shots spatted into the
sand breastwork and whined overhead. “We’re
strictly in for it, now.”</p>

<p>“If those fool cowpunch’s only knew what
they’re fightin’ for, they’d turn their artillery
the other way,” growled Starbuck. “I reckon
they’re the ‘Lazy X’ outfit, and Cummings, their
owner, is one of the High Line directors.”</p>

<p>“It’s a pity we can’t get word to them some
way,” said Smith. “We’re not out to kill anybody
if we can help it.”</p>

<p>“No, but they’re out to kill us,” grunted Williams,
as a second shower of bullets thudded into
the breastwork and tore up the gravel on either
hand. Then: “What are they doing now?”</p>

<p>The defenders of the breastwork were not left
long in doubt as to what was doing. The horsemen
in front were deploying in a thin line which
rapidly bent itself into a semi-circle across the
hill slope. To let any one of these skilled marksmen
gain the rear meant death for somebody,
and again Sprague gave the word of command.</p>

<p>“Better kill horses than men,” he said. “We’ve
got to stop that manœuvre,” and again the Winchesters
spoke, this time to deadlier purpose. At
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</span>the third volley two of the horses were down, and
the scattering line was drawing together again
and galloping out of range.</p>

<p>In the lull which succeeded, Williams dropped
his weapon and crawled quickly away to the edge
of the spillway torrent. When he came back
there was a new note of alarm in his voice.</p>

<p>“That spillway of ours is eating away the dam
at the rate of a foot a minute!” he announced.
“If we can’t get to work on it again, the whole
business will go out with a rush!”</p>

<p>It was a cruel dilemma, and it was quickly made
worse by a new movement on the part of the
attackers. Jennings’s party was closing in again,
and flashes of red fire were appearing here and
there on the hill-side to herald a dropping hail of
pistol bullets. Under cover of the irregular firing,
a man was worming his way down toward the
edge of the ravine through which the wasting
torrent was rushing out upon the mesa. It was
Sprague who first saw the crawling man and
divined his purpose.</p>

<p>“That’s Jennings!” he exclaimed, “and if he
reaches the edge of that gully, we’re all dead men!
Stop him, Starbuck! don’t kill him if you can help
it, but stop him!”</p>

<p>Starbuck levelled his short rifle over the top of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</span>the breastwork and took careful aim. The light
was bad and he could scarcely see the sights. At
the trigger-pulling, those who were watching saw
a little cloud of dust and gravel spring up directly
in front of the crawling man; saw this, and heard
above the roaring of the torrent his yell of pain
as he doubled up and clapped his hands to his
face.</p>

<p>“Good shot, Billy!” gritted the white-haired
colonel. “You’ve blinded him! Now if we could
only choke those crazy range-riders off.... Tarbell,
can’t you&mdash;where’s Tarbell gone?”</p>

<p>Tarbell’s place at the end of the breastwork was
empty, and Smith, who was next in the line, accounted
for him.</p>

<p>“Archer dropped out a minute or two ago. I
think he’s trying to make a dodge-around to get
at those cow-punchers.”</p>

<p>The firing had ceased for the moment, and the
man who had tried to creep down to the ravine
was stumbling back up the hill. Williams nervously
thrust in his plea again.</p>

<p>“I tell you, we’ve got to get to work on this
thing behind us and do it quick!” he urged.
“There is still water enough in the lake to tear the
heart out of Timanyoni Canyon if it all goes at
once!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</span></p>

<p>Sprague set the temerarious example by springing
to his feet, and the others followed him. There
was no answering volley from the hill-side. On the
contrary, the black blot of things animate on the
slope was melting away, and a minute later
Tarbell came running back.</p>

<p>“The boys have got their hunch!” he cried.
“A couple of them are taking Jennings back to
Angels, and the rest of ’em’ll be here in a minute
to help us. They didn’t know what was up.”</p>

<p>As one man the half-dozen flung themselves
upon the task of keeping the roaring crevasse
under control; and a little later eight of the cowmen
came racing down to swell the working force.
But even for the augmented numbers, it proved
to be a fiercely fought battle, with the issue hanging
perilously in the balance for a long time.</p>

<p>Hour by hour they toiled, making plank bulk-heads
out of the shack lumber, piling sand-bags
against the crumbling embankment, and fighting
inch by inch with the gnawing flood as the night
wore away.</p>

<p>And it was thus that the graying dawn found
them; soaked, muddied, gasping, and haggard
with fatigue, but with the victory fairly won. The
flood was still pouring through the gap which had
by now widened to the cutting away of a full half
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</span>of the dam; but the great body of water had already
passed out and there was no longer any
danger.</p>

<p>When the sun was just beginning to redden on
the higher peaks of the western mountains, a shout
from the hill-side road broke upon the morning
stillness. A moment later Maxwell and Stillings
came running to the brink of hazard.</p>

<p>Sprague stumbled up out of the crevasse chasm
and pointed down to the washed-out heart of the
dam. There, piled in the bottom of what had once
been the plank-lined pit with the hoisting-tackle
over it, and laid bare now by the scouring flood,
was a great pile of dynamite stacked solidly in its
shipping-boxes. And, half-buried in the sand and
detritus of the outflow, lay the iron pipe through
which the firing fuse had been carried to the gully
edge Jennings had tried to reach.</p>

<p>“There is the warrant for what we’ve been doing,
gentlemen,” said the big expert wearily.
“Take a good look at it, all of you, so that if the
courts have anything to say about this night’s
work&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Maxwell cut in quickly.</p>

<p>“There’s nobody left to make the fight. Jennings
went east from Angels on the first train that
got through. He was badly blinded, so Disbrow
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</span>says; got a fall from his horse, was the story he
told. We’ll fix this lay-out so it will stand just
as it is until everybody who wants to has seen it!”</p>

<p>“You couldn’t stay away, could you?” said the
white-haired colonel, grinning up from his seat
on the last of the sand-bags. “I told the boys
here you’d be turning up as soon as your railroad
track was open.”</p>

<p>“We’ve had a mighty anxious night,” Stillings
put in. “The river is up five feet, and we couldn’t
tell what was happening over here. Great Jonah!
but you men must have had your hands full!”</p>

<p>“We did,” said Smith; “but it’s all over now.”</p>

<p>“All but the shouting,” said Maxwell. “But
post your guards and let’s get back to town. My
car is at Angels, and we came up special. When
we left Brewster the plaza was black with people
waiting for news.”</p>

<p>It was on the way down the flood-swollen canyon
that the chemistry expert explained to the
private-car company at the breakfast-table how
he had been able to diagnose the case of the cloud-bursters.</p>

<p>“It was merely a bit of what you might call constructive
reasoning,” he said modestly. “I knew
by personal investigation in the line of my proper
work&mdash;soil-testing&mdash;that there was no arable land
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</span>within reach of the Mesquite project. The other
steps followed, as a matter of course. Starbuck,
here, is wondering why I risked his life and mine
to get a few photographs for <i>The Tribune</i>, but if
any of you will examine the snap-shots carefully
under a magnifier, you will see that they prove
the existence of the central pit in the dam, and
that one of them shows the pipe-line through which
the fuse was to run. For the possible legal purpose
I was anxious to have this evidence in indisputable
form. That’s all, I believe.”</p>

<p>“Not quite all,” Maxwell broke in. “How did
you know that Jennings would be hanging over
the wire at Angels while you people were making
your flying trip across the mountain in the auto?”</p>

<p>Sprague laughed good-naturedly.</p>

<p>“Call it a guess,” he said. “It was evident
that Jennings wasn’t anxious to kill a lot of innocent
people. His inquiries about the strength of
the High Line dam proved that. It ran in my
mind that he wouldn’t touch off his earthquake
until he could be reasonably sure that the flood
wouldn’t catch a train in transit in the canyon.
That would have been a little too horrible, even
for him. Now you’ve got it all, I guess.”</p>

<p>“But you haven’t got yours yet,” laughed
Stillings. “When this thing gets out in Brewster
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</span>the whole town will mob you and want to make
you the next mayor, or send you to Congress,
or something of that sort.”</p>

<p>“Not this year,” said the big man, with another
mellow laugh. “And I’ll tell you why. Just before
this train reaches town it’s going to stop and
let us law-breakers get off, scatter and drop into
town as best we can without calling attention to
ourselves. And to-morrow morning you’ll read
in <i>The Tribune</i> how the Mesquite dam, weakened
by the recent storms and cloud-bursts, went out
by littles during the night, watched over and
kept from going as a disastrous whole by a brave
little bunch of”&mdash;he looked around the table and
winked solemnly&mdash;“by a brave little bunch of
cowboys from the ‘Lazy X.’” Then, with sudden
soberness: “Promise me that you won’t give
it away, gentlemen all. It’s the only fee I shall
exact for my small part in the affair.”</p>

<p>And the promise was given while the locomotive
whistle was sounding for the Brewster yard-limits,
and Maxwell was pulling the air-cord for the out-of-town
stop.</p>

<span class="reduce">The High Kibosh</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">S</span>INCE it is a Western boast that the West
does nothing by halves, the Brewster Town
and Country Club owns two houses; a handsome
pink-lava home on one of the quieter business
streets of the city, and a rambling, overgrown
bungalow at the golf-links on the north shore
of the High Line reservoir lake, rechristened,
in honor of Colonel Baldwin’s pretty daughter,
“Lake Corona.”</p>

<p>On Saturday afternoons, which are bank holidays
in the progressive little inter-mountain city,
the links at Lake Corona are well patronized; and
on a certain Saturday in early September, in the
year written down in the annals of the inter-mountain
region as “the year of the great railroad
war,” one of the players was the big-muscled
athlete who figured for the Brewsterites as an expert
soil-tester in the Government service, and
whose nickname in the Timanyoni country was
“Scientific Sprague.”</p>

<p>Sprague’s opponent on the links on this particular
Saturday afternoon was Stillings, the railroad
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</span>lawyer; and at the conclusion of the game,
which had been a rather easy walk-over for the
big athlete, Stillings offered the winner a seat in
his runabout for the return to Brewster.</p>

<p>“Sorry, but I can’t go with you this time,
Robert,” said the heavy-weight, when he had
tipped his caddie and struggled into his coat.
“Maxwell is coming out to dinner and I promised
to wait for him. He thinks he is up for another
match game with the big-leaguers.”</p>

<p>Stillings paused with his hand on the dash of
the runabout. “That so?” he queried. “More
piracy?”</p>

<p>“Nothing actually in sight, as yet. But Dick
has been getting fresh tips from the New York
head-quarters. The big-money people who want
your railroad have been keeping pretty quiet since
the Mesquite fizzle; possibly they were afraid
you folks might have the evidence on them. But
now the air seems to be full of lightning again,
and nobody, not even President Ford himself,
appears to know just where it is going to strike.”</p>

<p>The lawyer reached over and retarded the spark
on the racing engines of the little car.</p>

<p>“It’s a queer fight,” he commented. “I never
heard of anything just like it before. Of course,
we all know what it means: the Transcontinental
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</span>needs our five-hundred-odd miles of Nevada Short
Line to put in with its Jack’s Canyon branch for
a short cut to the southern coast. Ordinarily,
those things are fought out on the floor of the
Stock Exchange, and the people who are operating
the railroad never know what hits them until
they’re safely dead. If the big fellows want the
Short Line so bad, why the dickens don’t they
go in and buy it up decently?”</p>

<p>The large man who had played such a successful
game of golf winked one eye solemnly.</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t expect a Government chemist
to find you the answer to any such conundrum as
that, would you?” he asked, in cheerful irony.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet you know, just the same,” asserted
Stillings confidently.</p>

<p>“I do happen to know, Robert,” was the even-toned
reply. “A financial transaction entered
into in the early summer by the Ford management&mdash;a
transaction having nothing whatever to
do with the fight&mdash;makes a break in prices absolutely
necessary before the control can be acquired.
What the Ford people did was to build
a solid wall of protection around themselves without
knowing it or intending to. They deposited
something like sixty per cent of the Short Line
stock with a syndicate of New York and Boston
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</span>banks as collateral for a loan to be used in double-tracking.”</p>

<p>“Still, I don’t see,” objected the lawyer.</p>

<p>“Don’t you? That sixty per cent of the stock&mdash;which
is the control&mdash;can’t be touched by any
fireworks business on the Exchange. The big-money
people have played the market up and
down with the forty per cent which is not pooled,
and nothing has happened. The loaning banks
have merely sat tight in the boat, knowing that
they held the joint control of a good paying property,
and that no amount of sky-rocketing on the
Street could make any difference, any real difference,
in the value of their collateral so long as
the property itself was earning dividends.”</p>

<p>“That is good as far as it goes,” said Stillings,
with a frown of perplexity. “But it doesn’t explain
why the big-money crowd, or somebody, has
been turning heaven and earth upside down all
summer to wreck, not the stock, but the property
itself. You know that is what has been done.
No stone has been left unturned, from demoralizing
Maxwell’s force to dynamiting tunnels and
planning forty-mile washouts. If big business
wants the road, why is it trying to wreck it physically?”</p>

<p>The big man who was fond of insisting that he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</span>was first, last, and all the time a Government
chemist grinned amiably.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t agree with your mentality to get
beaten at golf, does it, Robert?” he said jokingly.
“It is plain enough, when you get hold of the right
end of it. Big money’s play is to throw a real
scare, not into the stockholders, but into these
loaning bankers, don’t you see? If the road’s
earnings fall off and it has bad luck enough to
make these creditor-bankers really nervous about
the value of their collateral, the trick will be
turned. The Ford people will immediately be
asked to make good or pay up; and there you are.”</p>

<p>“Why, sure!” said the attorney, in a tone which
sufficiently emphasized his complete understanding.
Then he climbed slowly into the driving-seat
of the runabout. “I don’t see why some of
the rest of us haven’t caught on long ago,” he
went on. “I suppose any of us might have had
the simple facts if we had taken the trouble to dig
for them.” Then, abruptly: “You’re looking for
more trouble, Sprague?”</p>

<p>“Maxwell is; and so is Ford, apparently,” was
the evasive reply.</p>

<p>“Never mind Maxwell or Ford; you’re the
man,” snapped the lawyer.</p>

<p>“No, I’m not,” was the decisive denial. “It’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</span>true, I have been willing to help out and take a
hand in standing off a few of the attempted
smashings; but that was only because Dick Maxwell
is my friend, and it suited my humor to ride
my little reasoning hobby in his behalf. I’m not
a sleuth, Stillings; I’m a Government chemist, and
I am out here for the ostensible purpose of making
a technical report on the soils of this charming
valley of yours. You forget that every now and
then.”</p>

<p>“Pardon me, old man; I did forget it,” was the
hearty apology. “Just the same, you mustn’t
throw us down while the fight is still on. Maxwell
put it about right the other day when he
said that the Nevada Short Line would have been
dead and buried two months ago if it hadn’t been
for you.”</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, I can’t help out this time, Stillings.
That is why I am staying here this evening&mdash;to
meet Maxwell and tell him that he’ll have
to fight for his own hand if the New Yorkers
come after him again.”</p>

<p>“Good goodness, Sprague! what’s happened?”</p>

<p>“A thing which nobody could have foreseen,
and for which nobody is to blame. At the same
time, it lets me out. I’ve got to quit you.”</p>

<p>The attorney adjusted the spark and throttle
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</span>and cut the wheels of the little car preparatory
to the start.</p>

<p>“I can’t very well argue with you&mdash;not having
any grounds,” he said. “But I hope you won’t
decide finally until after you’ve had another talk
with Maxwell. Think it over between now and
dinner-time, and weigh the consequences to Dick,
Sprague. If there’s another earthquake on the
way, and you throw him down, he’s a ruined man.
I know what you will say: that he is well fixed
and doesn’t have to be a railroad superintendent.
That’s all right, but his job means more to him
than it might to a poor man; it’s his ambition.
If there is anything I can do&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The big chemistry expert shook his head.
“There isn’t anything that anybody can do,
Robert,” he said soberly; and at that, Stillings
eased the clutch in and drove away.</p>

<p>Two hours later Maxwell was sitting out the
after-dinner interval with his friend and classmate
on the broad lake-fronting veranda of the bungalow
club-house. It was a fine night, and the Saturday
evening crowd was larger than usual. There
was a dotting of canoes on the reservoir lake, and
the verandas were filling slowly as the great dining-room
emptied itself. For a time the two men
had let the talk drift into college reminiscences;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</span>but it took a more strictly personal turn when the
superintendent said:</p>

<p>“Do you know, Calvin, I’ve often wondered how
you came to be assigned to this job of soil-testing&mdash;this
particular job, I mean&mdash;for the Department.
It has been a sort of special providence to me;
but things don’t often happen that way, unhelped.”</p>

<p>“This thing didn’t happen that way&mdash;unhelped,”
was the big expert’s quiet rejoinder. “I
asked for the job.”</p>

<p>“I’ve wondered if you didn’t. It was mighty
good of you to maroon yourself out here in the tall
hills for the sake of helping me fight the money
pirates, Calvin.”</p>

<p>Sprague was silent for a full minute before he
said: “I wish I could claim a motive as disinterested
as that, Dick; but if I should, it wouldn’t
be honest. I had quite another reason for wishing
to return to the Timanyoni after my flying
trip through it last July on my way back from
California. I can’t tell you what it was; it’s too
idiotic for a grown man to own up to.”</p>

<p>The superintendent’s curling mustaches took a
grinning uptilt, and he laughed joyously.</p>

<p>“When you talk that way you don’t need to
tell me,” he chuckled. “It was a girl.”</p>

<p>“It was,” admitted the self-confessed simpleton,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</span>matching his accuser’s grin. “Since you’ve
guessed that much, I’ll tell you a little more. I
saw her first on your eastbound train, the train
that took on the sham dead man at Little Butte
and afterward picked up your office-car. You’ll
remember you asked me to stay over a day or
two with you in Brewster, and I did. As a matter
of fact, your persuasion wasn’t needed. I would
have stopped off anyway, because the girl stopped
off.”</p>

<p>“Heavens and earth!” ejaculated Maxwell, in
ecstatic appreciation; “how are the mighty fallen!
Lord of love! I never expected to see the day
when Cal Sprague, the idol of the foot-ball rooters,
would fall for a pretty face just seen, as you might
say, in passing! Oh, gosh!”</p>

<p>“Have your laugh, you old married hyena!”
grunted the late-comer in the sentimental field.
“I can’t get back at you because I didn’t happen
to be around when you were making seventeen
different kinds of a donkey of yourself over old
Hiram Fairbain’s daughter&mdash;as I have no doubt
you did. But that’s neither here nor there; the
young woman I’m speaking of tagged me, and I’m
It; I’ve been It ever since that first day on the
eastbound train.”</p>

<p>“And you say she stopped off in Brewster?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</span></p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“But you didn’t meet her?”</p>

<p>“No. You’ve been calling me an amateur
detective, Dick; I’m a fake! That girl and the
people she was with just vanished into thin air
the minute they hit the platform at the Brewster
station. I lost them as completely as if they had
stepped off into space.”</p>

<p>“So you came back, later, to hunt her up?”</p>

<p>“I did; or to try to get some trace of her&mdash;just
that.”</p>

<p>“Of course, it says itself that you have found
her.”</p>

<p>Sprague’s mellow laugh rumbled deep in his
chest.</p>

<p>“Richard, I have been here seven weeks, and
I found her&mdash;just three days ago! In all my
knocking around with you and Starbuck and
Stillings and the rest of you, not one man in the
bunch has thought it worth his while to tell me
that there is a cottage settlement of Eastern summer
people up in the mountains on Lake Topaz.
I had to blunder around and find out for myself,
as I did last Wednesday, when Starbuck took me
up to your mine on Mount Geechy.”</p>

<p>“Great guns!” exclaimed the superintendent;
“how in the name of common-sense was anybody
going to suspect that you needed to know? That
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</span>summer colony is as old as Brewster. But go
ahead and tell me more. I’m interested, if I don’t
look it.”</p>

<p>“There isn’t much to tell. I found her; met
her. She is stopping with an aunt of hers, and by
chance&mdash;good luck you’d say&mdash;I have something
a little better than a speaking acquaintance with
the aunt&mdash;through some common friends in New
York. There’s nothing to it, Richard. The girl
can have her pick&mdash;she has already turned down a
couple of English titles&mdash;and she isn’t going to
pick any such overgrown slob of a man as your
humble. Let’s talk about something else.”</p>

<p>“If I branch off, it will be into my own grief,”
said Maxwell half-reluctantly. “I had another
wire from Ford this afternoon. The big-money
people are getting ready to swat us again, and
Ford admits that he can’t find out where it is to
come from, or what it is to be. If it wasn’t for
the name of the thing, and what I owe Ford, I’d
be about ready to throw up my job, Calvin. I
have money enough to live on, and this business
of dragging along from day to day with the feeling
that any minute you may get the knife between
your ribs isn’t very exhilarating.”</p>

<p>“You say Ford can’t give you any hint of what
is coming next?”</p>

<p>“Not the slightest. But there is something in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</span>the wind. You know Kinzie, the president of the
Brewster National Bank? He cornered me last
night at the club and asked a lot of queer questions
that didn’t seem to have any particular bearing
on anything.”</p>

<p>“What kind of questions?” inquired the expert.</p>

<p>“Oh, about our right-of-way through the town
of Copah, and about our outstanding floating
debts, and finally about a ridiculous damage
suit that has been dragging its way through the
courts.”</p>

<p>Sprague sat up and relighted his fat, black cigar.</p>

<p>“What about the damage suit?” he asked.</p>

<p>“It’s a piker’s graft,” was the half-impatient
rejoinder. “We have a little branch line over to
the bauxite mines in the western edge of the
county. The telegraph company doesn’t maintain
an office, and our agent is authorized to handle
what few commercial telegrams there are. It
seems that one came for a man named Hixon, a
prospector whose exact whereabouts could not be
ascertained at the moment. The message was
three days old when it was delivered, and Hixon
sued for ten thousand dollars damages; said he’d
lost the sale of a mine by the delay.”</p>

<p>“You are fighting the suit?”</p>

<p>“Of course&mdash;it’s point-blank robbery! Stillings
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</span>has had the case postponed two or three times in
the hope of wearing Hixon out. It comes up
again next week, I believe.”</p>

<p>“And you say Kinzie was curious about this
lawsuit?”</p>

<p>“Yes. It seems that Hixon is, or has been, a
customer of the bank; and Kinzie suggested that
we ought to compromise.”</p>

<p>“Um,” said the big-bodied man thoughtfully.
“In whose court does the case come up?”</p>

<p>“In Judge Watson’s.”</p>

<p>“Has Hixon a good lawyer?”</p>

<p>“He has the Kentucky colonel, suh,” laughed
Maxwell; “our one original, dyed-in-the-wool,
fire-eating spellbinder from the Blue-grass. When
Colonel Bletchford gets upon his feet and turns
loose, you can hear the bird of freedom scream
all the way across Timanyoni Park.”</p>

<p>The big chemistry expert with the athletic slant
was moving uneasily in his chair. After a little
interval of silence he said: “I can’t be with you
in any more of these little two-steps with the
money trust, Richard. I’m going back to Washington
to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Maxwell’s start carried him half-way out of his
chair, and he dropped his short pipe and broke
the stem of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</span></p>

<p>“Great Scott, Calvin&mdash;don’t say that!” he implored.
“You can’t throw us down that way!
Why, good Lord, man, if it hadn’t been for you
and your brains.... But, pshaw! there’s no use
in talking about it; you simply <i>can’t</i> go and leave
us hanging over the ragged edge!”</p>

<p>“I can; and I guess I must,” insisted Sprague
gently. “And the worst of it is, Dick, I can’t
tell you or anybody else the why. It’s just up
to me, and I’ve got it to do.”</p>

<p>Maxwell’s perturbation had cleared his brain
like a bucketing of cold water. “Tell me, Calvin,”
he broke out; “is the girl mixed up in it?”</p>

<p>“She is,” was the brief admission.</p>

<p>“Is she gone, or going&mdash;back East, I mean?”</p>

<p>“N-no; not immediately, I believe.”</p>

<p>Maxwell sat back in his chair and began to
twist nervously at the charm on his watch-fob.</p>

<p>“I suppose I haven’t any kick coming,” he said
at length. “What you have done for me this
summer couldn’t be measured in money, and I
have no right to ask you to go on giving your
time and your brains on the score of friendship.”</p>

<p>“There isn’t any bigger score in this little old
round world of ours, Dick,” said the other gravely.
“I’m a cold-blooded fish, and I know it. I ought
to stand by you; every decent thing in me but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</span>one urges me to stand by you. But that one
exception queers me. I hope you’ll win out; I
hope to God you’ll win out, Dick; but I can’t be
the man to put the club into your hands this time.”</p>

<p>The snappy little superintendent took his defeat
hard. For some further time he used every
argument he could devise to persuade Sprague to
change his mind. But at the end the big man
was shaking his head regretfully.</p>

<p>“It’s no use, Richard,” he said finally. “If
you were in my place, you’d do just as I’m doing&mdash;and
for the same reason. Let’s go back to
town. It’s too cheerful here to fit either one of
us just now.”</p>

<p>Maxwell had driven out to the club-house on
the shore of Lake Corona in his small car, and
when he returned to town Sprague occupied the
mechanician’s seat beside him. It was a run of
only a few miles, over the best driving road in
the county, and there was neither time nor the
occasion for much talk.</p>

<p>When the car had trundled across the Timanyoni
bridge and the viaduct over the railroad
tracks, Maxwell would have set Sprague down at
his hotel across the plaza from the station; but
Sprague himself objected. “You are going over
to your office? I’ll go with you, if you don’t
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</span>mind. It’s my last evening, and I’m not in the
humor to sit it out alone. I won’t interfere, if
you want to work,” was the way he put it.</p>

<p>It was thus it happened that they climbed the
stair to the second story of the railroad building
together, and together walked down the corridor
to the door of the despatcher’s room. Connolly,
the fat night despatcher, was at his glass-topped
table behind the counter railing, and when he
saw the superintendent he held up a pudgy hand.</p>

<p>“Benson’s been trying to get you on the wire
from Copah for an hour or more, Mr. Maxwell,”
he said. “I didn’t know where to raise you.”</p>

<p>“Is he on the wire now?” asked Maxwell, letting
himself and his companion through the wicket
in the counter rail.</p>

<p>“No; but I’ll call him for you.” Followed a
sharp rattling of the key and a few broken snippings
from the sounder, and then the despatcher
got up out of his chair. “Here he is,” he said.
“He wants to talk to you, personally.”</p>

<p>Maxwell took the vacated chair and key, and
Connolly stood aside with the big expert. “Seems
right good to have you dropping in every now and
then, Mr. Sprague,” said the fat one. “You’d
ought to belong to us out here. We’d sure make
it warm for you in the Short Line family.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</span></p>

<p>Sprague looked the dumpling-like despatcher
over in mild and altogether friendly criticism.</p>

<p>“Speaking of families: you got married yourself
a little while ago, didn’t you, Dan?” he asked.</p>

<p>“You bet I did!” was the enthusiastic reply.
“Sadie ain’t got done talking yet about that set
of knives and forks you sent her from Philadelphia.”</p>

<p>Again the big-muscled man was looking the
despatcher over critically, this time with a quizzical
twinkle in his gray eyes.</p>

<p>“Tell me how you did it, Dan,” he urged
soberly. “You’re fatter than I ever dared to be.
How did you manage to make a girl believe that
there might be a man inside of a big body as well
as in a medium-sized one?”</p>

<p>The night despatcher laughed until his moon-like
face was purple; until the car-record clerk in
the distant corner of the room looked up from his
type-writer to see if he, too, might not share the
joke.</p>

<p>“Gi-give me a little time,” wheezed Connolly;
and he was presumably going to tell how it had
been done when Maxwell got up from the glass-topped
table and broke in.</p>

<p>“Twenty-six is asking for orders, Dan,” he said;
and when Connolly had resumed his chair and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</span>his key: “That’s all, Calvin. We’ll go across to
my office, if you like.”</p>

<p>It was behind the closed door of the superintendent’s
room, after Sprague had chosen the
easiest of the three chairs and settled himself for
a smoke, that Maxwell said:</p>

<p>“I’m going to miss you like the devil, Calvin;
I’m missing you right now.”</p>

<p>Sprague blew a series of smoke rings toward the
disused gas-fixture hanging from the centre of the
ceiling.</p>

<p>“Something that Chief Engineer Benson has
been telling you over the wire from Copah?” he
suggested.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Another series of the smoke rings, and then:
“Well, I didn’t tell you you couldn’t talk, did
I?”</p>

<p>Maxwell did not haggle over the inverted terms
of the permission to talk. The necessity was too
pressing.</p>

<p>“Benson has struck something that he can’t
account for. For a week or more the Transcontinental
people have been gathering a working
camp at the Copah end of the bridge on which
their Jack’s Canyon branch crosses the Pannikin.
Nobody seems to know what they are going to do,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</span>or where they are going to do it. At Leckhard’s
suggestion, I sent Benson over to pry around a
little.”</p>

<p>“And he hasn’t found out what the T-C. folks
have in mind?”</p>

<p>“No, he hasn’t. But it is plainly some sort of
a track-building job. He says they have a hundred
or more scraper-teams in camp, a train-load
of new steel, and forty car-loads of cross-ties. And
this afternoon they brought down a mechanical
rail-layer&mdash;a machine much used nowadays for
rushing a job of track-laying.”</p>

<p>The big guest smoked reflectively for a full minute
or more before he said: “No jangle with the
Copah city authorities about any trackage rights
in the town, or street crossings, or anything of
that sort?”</p>

<p>“Not that I have ever heard of. The T-C. has
its own Copah yard, and has a switching connection
with the Pacific Southwestern yard tracks;
though, naturally, there is little exchange of business
between the two competitive systems.”</p>

<p>“Do they connect with you?” asked Sprague.</p>

<p>“Not directly. Our yard was originally an
independent lay-out, lying a mile to the west of
town. When the Short Line became a grand division
of the Pacific Southwestern, the two yards,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</span>ours and the P. S-W., were operated as one,
though they are still separate lay-outs.”</p>

<p>“I see. What else does Benson say?”</p>

<p>“He has been asking questions and chewing the
rag with anybody who would talk, he says; but we
all know Jack. He is too downright and bluff to
be much of a detective.”</p>

<p>Maxwell turned to his desk and began on the
ever-present pile of waiting work; and the big
expert settled himself more deeply into his chair
and smoked on with his gaze fixed upon the ceiling
gas-pendant. After the lapse of many minutes
he said: “Have you a blue-print of the Copah
yards, Dick?”</p>

<p>Maxwell rose and went to a filing-case in the
corner of the office. After a little search he found
the required blue-print and gave it to Sprague, explaining
the locations and the relative positions
of the three railroad yards. The expert studied
the map thoughtfully, even going so far as to
scrutinize the fine lettering on it with the help of
a small pocket magnifying-glass.</p>

<p>“And right over here by the river is where you
say the new camp has been pitched?” he asked,
indicating the spot with the handle of the magnifier.</p>

<p>“Yes; Benson says it’s at the south end of the
bridge, and just west of the T-C. bridge siding.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</span></p>
<p>Sprague looked up quickly. “Did Benson say
they had an electric-light outfit for night work?”</p>

<p>“Why, no; I don’t remember that he did.”</p>

<p>“Go and ask him,” said Sprague shortly; and
the superintendent, who had learned to take the
expert’s suggestions without question, left the
office to do it.</p>

<p>He was back in a few minutes, with the light
of a newly kindled excitement in his eyes.</p>

<p>“By Jove, Calvin, you’re a wizard!” he exclaimed.
“Your guess is better than another
man’s eyesight. They’ve not only got the light
outfit&mdash;they’ve strung it up and gone to work!
Benson says they are laying a track out across the
valley of the Pannikin like this,” and he traced
a curving line on the blue-print, which Sprague
was still holding spread out on his knees.</p>

<p>Sprague nodded slowly. “That is move Number
One,” he said. “Dick, you’re in for a fight to
a finish, this time. They’ve got you foul in some
way, and they are so sure of it that they are already
beginning to take possession. Don’t you
see what this new track means?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t,” Maxwell confessed, with a frown
of perplexity.</p>

<p>“You will see before to-morrow night. Pull
yourself together, old man, and do a little clear-headed
reasoning. Why are these people starting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</span>out to build a railroad at ten o’clock Saturday
night? Surely you’ve had experience enough in
crossing fights to know what that means!”</p>

<p>Maxwell straightened up and swore out of a full
heart.</p>

<p>“You mean that they are going to cut a crossing
through the Southwestern main line, and do it on
Sunday, when our people can’t stop them with a
court injunction?”</p>

<p>“You’ve surrounded at least half of it,” said the
expert. “The other half will come later. If I
wasn’t going away to-morrow&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Maxwell walked to the window and stared
across at the flaming arc light hanging in front of
the Hotel Topaz on the opposite side of the plaza.
When he turned again, Sprague had rolled the blue-print
into a tube and was laying it on the desk.</p>

<p>“Calvin, you’ve had time to think it over,”
said the man at the window. “You haven’t made
it very plain for me, but I can understand that it’s
friendship against&mdash;against the girl. I’m human
enough to know what that means, but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Sprague was holding up one of his big square-fingered
hands in protest.</p>

<p>“I have been thinking it over, Dick,” he admitted
gently. “I’ll stay&mdash;for the line-up, anyway.
But it’s only fair to warn you that I may
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</span>drop out at any minute; perhaps when the game
is going dead against you. Now we’ll get action.
You go back to the wire and keep in touch with
Benson. We want to know at the earliest possible
moment exactly what it is that the T-C. people
are trying to do. While you’re wiring, I’ll
go out and try to find Stillings.”</p>

<p>This was the situation at ten o’clock on Saturday
night. At the nine-o’clock Sunday morning
breakfast in the Topaz café, when Maxwell,
hollow-eyed and haggard from his night’s vigil
at the wires, next had speech with Sprague, the
news from the seat of war at Copah was sufficiently
exciting.</p>

<p>As Maxwell had predicted, the Transcontinental
track-layers had built up to the Southwestern
main line, and had finally succeeded in
cutting a crossing through it, though not without
a fight. The Southwestern force, with Leckhard,
the division superintendent, at its head,
had resisted as it could. Since it was past midnight,
with no hope of obtaining legal help until
Monday morning, Leckhard had “spotted” a locomotive
on the crossing, and when the men in
charge of it were overborne by numbers, the engine
had been derailed and “killed” before it was
abandoned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</span></p>

<p>The stubborn resistance had purchased nothing
more than a short delay. The marauders had
a wrecking-crane as part of their equipment; and
half an hour after its abandonment the derailed
Southwestern engine had been toppled over into
the ditch, and the track-layers were at work installing
the crossing frogs.</p>

<p>“And after that?” queried Sprague, when Maxwell
had told of the losing fight at the main line
crossing.</p>

<p>“After that they went on building across the
valley and heading for the western end of our
yard. At the last report, which came about eight
o’clock, they had less than a mile of steel to lay
before they would be on our right-of-way. Benson
is crazy. He is yelling at me now to petition
the governor for the militia.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t done anything?”</p>

<p>“There isn’t anything to do. They are on neutral
ground, now, and will be until they reach our
right-of-way&mdash;if that is what they are heading
for. We have no manner of right to interfere
with them until they become actual trespassers;
and as for that, no physical force we could muster
would stop them. Benson says there are between
four and five hundred men in that track
gang, and many of them are armed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</span></p>

<p>Sprague nodded. “It is a fight to a finish, as
I told you last night. And they have the advantage
because we don’t know yet where or how they
are going to hit us. Have you communicated
with Ford?”</p>

<p>“I have tried to; but I don’t get any reply.”</p>

<p>“Tally!” said the big man on the opposite side
of the table. “I’ve been having the same kind
of bad luck. I can’t locate Stillings.”</p>

<p>“Did you try his house?”</p>

<p>“I did that first. His family is out of town,
and he has been stopping at the club. But nobody
there seems to know anything about him.
A little after midnight I found your division
detective, young Tarbell, and put him on the
job. We’re needing Stillings, and needing him
badly.”</p>

<p>“Tarbell hasn’t reported back yet?”</p>

<p>“Not yet; it is beginning to look as if he had
dropped out, too. But the day is still young.
You’d better go upstairs and get a little sleep.
I’ll stay on deck and call you if you are needed.”</p>

<p>Maxwell had finished his simple breakfast and
he took the good advice. It was nine hours later,
and the electrics were twinkling yellow in the sunset
pinks and grays flooding the quiet Sunday
evening streets and the railroad plaza, when he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</span>came down and found Sprague just ready to go
in to dinner.</p>

<p>“News!” demanded the superintendent eagerly.
“I had no idea of wasting the day this way.”</p>

<p>Sprague made him wait until they were seated
at a table for two in the corner of the café.</p>

<p>“The Copah fight is over, and the T-C. people
have broken into your yards with their new track,”
the expert announced briefly. “Benson had to
give up and go to bed about noon, but Leckhard
has kept us posted. The track is in, and frogged
to a connection with your main line; and the
entire attacking force has camped down at the
two points of trespass; presumably to keep you
and Leckhard from interfering and tearing up
their job. Move Number One, whatever it may
mean, is a move accomplished.”</p>

<p>“I can’t understand; I can’t begin to understand!”
said Maxwell, in despair. And then:
“No word yet from Ford?”</p>

<p>“No; and what is more to the point, there is
none from Stillings&mdash;nor from Tarbell. I’m beginning
to think that this is a bigger game than any
we’ve played yet, Dick. I dug up Editor Kendall,
of <i>The Tribune</i>, this afternoon, and had a
little heart-to-heart talk with him. There is big
trouble of some sort in the air; he has smelled it,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</span>but he can’t tell what it is. He has his young
men out everywhere, ‘on suspicion,’ and he has
promised to keep in touch with us up to the
time his paper goes to press.”</p>

<p>“That ought to help us to get at the facts,”
said the superintendent. “Kendall is our friend,
and he has some mighty keen young fellows on his
staff. By the way, there’s one of them now&mdash;just
coming in at the door. He’s looking for somebody,
too.”</p>

<p>The young incomer was not long in finding his
man. With a nod to the head-waiter, he came
across to Sprague’s table. “A note for you, Mr.
Sprague&mdash;from Mr. Kendall,” he said. “There’s
no answer, I believe,” and he went on to another
table and began to chat with two other young
men, strangers to Maxwell, who had come in on
the evening train.</p>

<p>Sprague glanced at his note and passed it across
the table. Maxwell read it and found that it
merely added to the mysteries without offering
anything in the way of enlightenment.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="no-indent">“<span class="smcap">Dear Sprague</span>:</p>

<p>“Have followed your suggestion, and our young
men have spotted at least a score of the strangers
at the different hotels. Nobody seems to know
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</span>any of them, and they won’t talk. You will find
a list of names, copied from the hotel registers,
on enclosed slip. It has occurred to me that
Maxwell might know some of them, if your suspicions
are well founded.</p>

<p class="no-indent right2">“<span class="smcap">Kendall.</span>”</p></div>

<p>Maxwell frowned over the list for a moment
before handing it back.</p>

<p>“A few of them are familiar,” he said. “Tom
Carmody is a division superintendent on the west
end of the T-C., and this man Hunniwell used to
be in their legal department. Vance Jackson is,
or used to be, Carmody’s chief despatcher; and&mdash;why,
say! this is a T-C. crowd; here’s Andy
Cochran, their Canyon Division trainmaster.”</p>

<p>“Any more?” asked Sprague quietly.</p>

<p>“No; the other names are all strange to me.”</p>

<p>Sprague took the list and pointed with a square-ended
forefinger to one of the names.</p>

<p>“This man Dimmock; you don’t know him?”
he queried.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know him, either; but I happen
to know something about him. Two years ago I
was doing a little soil work down in Oklahoma.
It was during the time they were having the scrap
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</span>with the oil companies. Mr. Dimmock was there,
ostensibly as an independent capitalist from the
East looking for bargains in oil-wells, but really as
a representative of the trust.”</p>

<p>“Is this the same man?”</p>

<p>The expert held his fork pointing diagonally
across his plate. “Follow the line of this fork,”
he directed in low tones, “and you’ll see him&mdash;at
the farther table by the door.”</p>

<p>Maxwell looked and saw a generously built,
smooth-shaven, cold-featured man who looked
like big money, dining at a table alone. The big-money
look was not obtrusive; but it was sufficiently
apparent in the city cut of the Sunday
broadcloth, in the spotless linen, and not less in
the attitude of the obsequious waiter who hovered
around the great man’s chair.</p>

<p>“I took the trouble to look up Mr. Dimmock
in the Oklahoma period,” Sprague went on. “I
found that he was pretty well known in New York
as the right hand of a certain great money lord
whose name we needn’t mention here. That being
the case, it is hardly necessary to add that his
presence in Brewster at this particular crisis is a
bit ominous.”</p>

<p>“Have you told Kendall this about Dimmock?”
asked the superintendent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</span></p>

<p>“No; but he’ll be pretty sure to trace the gentleman
for himself. Where a question of pure news
is involved, Kendall is apt to be found running well
ahead of the field.”</p>

<p>“But that doesn’t help us out any,” Maxwell
objected.</p>

<p>“No. We seem to be forced to await developments;
and that, Richard, is always a mark of the
losing side. I wish to goodness Stillings would
turn up.”</p>

<p>“It’s odd about Bob. He doesn’t often drop
out without leaving a trail behind him. Have you
finished? Then let’s go over to the office and see
if there is any further word from Benson or Leckhard.”</p>

<p>It was when they were leaving the dining-room
together that they came upon Tarbell, the ex-terror
of Montana cattle thieves. The young man
was way-worn and dusty, and his eyes were red for
want of sleep. Sprague’s question was shot-like.</p>

<p>“You’ve found him, Archer?”</p>

<p>“Yep; as good as,” was the short rejoinder.</p>

<p>“Turn it loose,” commanded Sprague.</p>

<p>“He’s at the bottom of an old prospect hole
up on Mount Baldwin; him and Mr. Maxwell’s
brother-in-law, Billy Starbuck. I had to come
back to town to get a rope to pull ’em out.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</span></p>

<p>“What?” said Maxwell. “How did they get
there?”</p>

<p>The young special deputy shook his head.</p>

<p>“I don’t know the whys an’ wherefores any more
’n a goat,” he said simply. “I got onto it through
the barkeep’ at the road-house out on the Topaz
pike. He said a bunch o’ fellas came along in an
auto late last night and stopped for drinks. They
come in two at a time, and two of ’em didn’t come
in at all. Just as they was startin’ off, there was
a scrap o’ some sort in the auto, and the barkeep’,
who was lookin’ out o’ the window, swore to me
he got a glimpse o’ Mr. Stillings. I found the
auto tracks and followed ’em. They left the
road this side o’ the lake, crossed the Gloria on the
bridge, and shoved that machine up an old wood
trail on Baldwin.”</p>

<p>“Well, go on,” said Maxwell, impatiently.</p>

<p>“I found where they’d stopped and took Mr.
Stillings and Billy out o’ the car; and it sure
looked as if there’d been another scrap, the way the
bushes was tore up. About a quarter back from
the trail I found the hole. Starbuck hollered up
at me when I peeked in. I couldn’t see ’em none,
but Billy he said they was both there, and wasn’t
hurt none to speak of&mdash;only in their feelin’s. He
told me to chase back and get a rope.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</span></p>

<p>Maxwell looked at his watch. “How deep is
this hole, Archer?”</p>

<p>“’Bout a hundred foot, or maybe more.”</p>

<p>“We’ll get a car and go after them,” was the
superintendent’s instant decision. “You say this
was last night; have they had anything to eat?”</p>

<p>“Yep; Billy said a basket o’ grub had been
lowered down to ’em a little spell after they was
chucked in.”</p>

<p>“All right. Go over to the shops and get a coil
of rope out of the wrecking-car, and I’ll get an
auto. Want to go along, Calvin?”</p>

<p>“Sure,” was the prompt reply.</p>

<p>Maxwell, being a reasonably wealthy mine
owner, as well as the superintendent of the railroad,
kept two cars; a runabout and a big touring-machine
which, in the absence of his family, were
both housed in a down-town garage. In the big
car the twenty-mile drive over the Topaz Lake
pike was quickly made.</p>

<p>Just before they came to the bridge over the
Gloria, they passed an auto with two men in it
going toward town. Oddly enough, as it seemed,
the in-bound car gave them a wide berth, steering
almost into the ditch at the passing, and speeding
up to a racing clip as soon as the ditched machine
had been yanked back into the roadway. Tarbell,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</span>who was driving the Maxwell car, stopped, jumped
out, and examined the tracks of the other car by
the help of a lighted match.</p>

<p>“That’s them,” he said laconically, when he
resumed the steering-wheel. “That was the same
car. It’s got a set o’ them new-fangled tires with
creepers on ’em.”</p>

<p>“Hurry!” snapped Maxwell. “We don’t know
what they’ve been doing to Stillings and Billy,
this time.”</p>

<p>Happily they soon found that the evening
visit of the two unknown men to the abandoned
prospect shaft had been charitable rather than
malevolent. Stillings, who was the first of the
two captives to be hauled out of the dark pit on
the mountain side, told them that another basket
of food had just been lowered by a string into the
shaft. And when Starbuck came up he brought
the basket with him.</p>

<p>Singularly enough, the two rescued ones had
no explanation to offer; or, at least, none that
served to explain anything. It transpired that
they had dined together in the town house of the
club the evening before, and had afterward gone
to the theatre together. After the play they had
taken a taxi to go to Stillings’s house in the suburbs
to sleep. An auto had followed them, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</span>when they had dismissed the taxi they had been
set upon by a number of masked men who tumbled
out of the pursuing car. Since they had no
weapons, they were quickly overpowered, thrown
into the car, carried off to the mountains, and
dumped into the prospect hole, the rope by which
they had been lowered being thrown in after them.
That was all.</p>

<p>“And you don’t know what it was for?” asked
Sprague, when they were rolling evenly back to
the city with Starbuck at the steering-wheel.</p>

<p>“No more than you do,” was the lawyer’s
answer. “Billy and I have speculated over it all
day&mdash;having no other way of amusing ourselves&mdash;and
it’s a perfectly blind trail. Billy says he
knows I must have been the one they were after,
and I say he must have been the one. You can
take your choice.”</p>

<p>At the club town house the two rescued ones
were set down, and Tarbell was released to go and
get his well-earned rest after the twenty-four-hour
task of shadow work.</p>

<p>“Get yourself in shape to go on an advisory
committee with us as soon as you can, Robert,”
was Sprague’s injunction to the attorney; and
then Maxwell drove down to the railroad building,
and the expert was with him when he went up to
the despatcher’s office.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</span></p>

<p>There was no more news from the Copah seat
of war, two hundred miles to the eastward, or, at
most, nothing different. The huge alien track-laying
force was still guarding the crossing through
the Southwestern main line and the new junction
with the Nevada Short Line in the western yards.
Leckhard reported that Benson was sleeping off
his fatigues of the previous night, and said that all
was quiet on the late battle-ground.</p>

<p>“And still no word from Ford!” said Maxwell,
as he and Sprague, having put the car up at
the garage, walked back to the hotel. “By and
large, Calvin, that is the most mysterious thing
in the bunch. I can’t understand it.”</p>

<p>“Unless I am much mistaken, we shall all understand
many things to-morrow that we can’t
appreciate to-night,” was Sprague’s prediction;
and long after Maxwell had gone back to his office
to put in a make-up period at his desk, the big-bodied
man from Washington sat out on the loggia
porch of the hotel smoking in thoughtful solitude
and staring absently at the unwinking eyes of the
mast-head electrics in the railroad yard diagonally
opposite.</p>

<p>The Monday morning dawned bright and fair,
as a vast majority of the mornings do in the
favored inter-mountain paradise known as Timanyoni
Park. Notwithstanding his long Sunday
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</span>sleep, Maxwell came down late to his breakfast,
and the café waiter told him that Sprague
had eaten at his usually early hour and was
gone.</p>

<p>While he was waiting to be served, the superintendent
glanced through the morning <i>Tribune</i>.
There was a rather exciting first-page news story
of the track-laying fight at Copah. The story
was evidently an Associated Press despatch, and
was carefully non-committal in its reference to
the Transcontinental’s purpose in rushing the new
trackage through to a connection with the Nevada
Short Line yards. None the less, the impression
was given that the Southwestern’s opposition
to the move had been only perfunctory and
for public effect. Also, the impression was conveyed
that the Copah public, at least, believed
that there was a secret understanding between
the two railroad corporations.</p>

<p>Turning to the inside pages, Maxwell found no
editorial comment on the news story, and he was
still wondering why Editor Kendall had missed
his chance when Stillings came in and took the
chair at the end of the table.</p>

<p>“They told me I’d find you here,” said the lawyer,
“and I wanted to have a word with you before
the wheels begin to go round. This is our
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</span>day in court on the Hixon damage suit, and we’ll
have to fish or cut bait this time. In all probability,
we sha’n’t be able to get another postponement,
and if we let the case come to trial,
it’s all off. The jury will give Hixon his verdict,
if only for the reason that he is one man fighting
a corporation. The only question is, shall I try
to compromise before it is too late?”</p>

<p>“Is there any chance for a compromise?” asked
Maxwell.</p>

<p>“I don’t know positively. Bletchford was willing
a few weeks ago, but his figure was so high
that I refused to talk to him.”</p>

<p>“It’s a hold-up!” snapped the superintendent
shortly. “I haven’t changed my mind.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said the attorney, rising to go.
“I thought I’d give you one last chance at it.
The case is called for ten o’clock in Judge Watson’s
court. If you’re foot-loose, you might come
up and see us lose ten thousand dollars. I guess
that is what it will come to.” And then, as he
was turning to go: “By the way, that was a
mighty cold-blooded thing the T-C. people did
yesterday, wasn’t it? What does it mean?”</p>

<p>“If Sprague hasn’t told you, I’m sure I can’t.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t seen Sprague. He left a note at the
office this morning, saying he’d be around later;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</span>but he hasn’t shown up yet. Will you come over
to the court-house and see the jury sand-bag
us?”</p>

<p>Quite naturally, the hard-working superintendent
had no notion of wasting his forenoon in a
court-room, and he said so tersely. And beyond
Stillings’s departure and the finishing of the late
breakfast, he went across to his office and plunged
into the day’s tasks.</p>

<p>There was an unusual quantity of the work
that morning, it seemed, and no sooner was he
through with one file of referred papers than
Calmaine, the chief clerk, was ready with another.
Only once during the forenoon was the
steady office grind lightened by an interruption
from the outside world. At ten o’clock Benson
wired from Copah, saying that the T-C. track-layers
were at work again, carefully surfacing and
ballasting the new track as if it were to be a permanency.
Also, the chief engineer asked if any
legal steps had been taken looking to the prevention
of further trespass.</p>

<p>Maxwell broke the routine pace long enough
to dictate to Calmaine the reply to Benson’s asking.
It stated the facts briefly. No legal steps
had as yet been taken. A full report of the intrusion
had gone to the Pacific Southwestern
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</span>head-quarters in New York, and no action would
be taken until New York had spoken.</p>

<p>It was a little before noon when Calmaine carried
away the final files of claim correspondence
with the superintendent’s notations on them, and
Maxwell sat back in his chair and relighted his
cigar, which had gone out many times during the
stressful morning. In the act the door of the
private office suddenly opened and the heavy-set,
neatly groomed gentleman whom Sprague
had pointed out at the hotel dinner-table the
previous evening walked in and took the chair
at the desk end, removing his hat and wiping
his brow with a handkerchief filmy enough to
have figured as the <i>mouchoir</i> of a fine lady.</p>

<p>“Mr. Maxwell, I believe?” he said, dropping a
card bearing the single line, “C. P. Dimmock,”
on the desk.</p>

<p>“That is my name,” returned Maxwell, bristling
with a wholly unaccountable prickling of antagonism.</p>

<p>“I have come, as an officer of Judge Watson’s
court, to take over your railroad,” announced the
cold-featured man calmly, and as he said it, the
telephone buzzer under Maxwell’s desk went off
as though a general fire-alarm had been sounded
from the central office.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</span></p>

<p>Maxwell reached for the telephone and put the
receiver to his ear. It was Stillings who was at
the other end of the wire, and he was frantically
incoherent. But out of the attorney’s coruscating
babblement the superintendent picked enough to
enable him to surround the principal fact. In the
face of all precedent, in defiance of all its legal
rights, the Nevada Short Line had been practically
declared bankrupt and a receiver had been
appointed.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding his nerve, which was ordinarily
very good, the snappy little superintendent’s
hand trembled when he replaced the ear-piece
on its hook and turned to his visitor.</p>

<p>“So you’ve got us at last, have you, Mr. Dimmock?”
he said, constraining himself to speak
calmly. “It was on the Hixon case, our attorney
tells me.”</p>

<p>The visitor nodded blandly.</p>

<p>“You should have compromised that case, Mr.
Maxwell&mdash;if you will allow me the privilege of
criticising, after the fact. But we needn’t come
to blows over the purely academic question. Judge
Watson has appointed me receiver&mdash;temporary,
of course&mdash;for the railroad property. I am here
to take charge in the interest of all concerned, and
I am assuming that you won’t put yourself in contempt
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</span>of court by any ill-considered resistance.
Here is the court order.” And he tossed a folded
paper across to the desk.</p>

<p>For the moment Maxwell was speechless. Then
he slowly straightened up and took a few packets
of papers out of the desk pigeon-holes marked
“R. Maxwell, Private,” putting them into his
pocket. That done, he removed the desk and
door keys from his pocket ring and laid them upon
the desk.</p>

<p>“I think that is about as far as I have to go,
personally,” he said, rising and reaching for his
hat. “And, of course, I have nothing to ask
for myself. But for the staff and the rank and
file, Mr. Dimmock&mdash;I hope you’re not going to
make a clean sweep. We have a mighty good
working organization, and it will cause a great
deal of hardship if you take the usual course of
discharging and replacing all heads of departments.”</p>

<p>The new head of all departments smiled, and
in the smile much of the cold hardness of his face
disappeared.</p>

<p>“That is a matter with which I shall have very
little to do, Mr. Maxwell,” he returned. “Mr.
Carmody, lately in charge of the Transcontinental’s
Pacific Division, will be my operating
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</span>chief, and I am sure that you yourself, as a
practical railroad man, would counsel me to give
him a free hand.”</p>

<p>Maxwell took the additional bitter dose of the
medicine of defeat like a man, but he made one
more attempt&mdash;an attempt to save Calmaine’s
head.</p>

<p>“My chief clerk,&mdash;the young man who admitted
you here,&mdash;I hope you can provide for him,
Mr. Dimmock. Apart from any personal relations,
I have found him the most faithful, the most
painstaking&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The new receiver lifted a faultlessly manicured
hand in genial protest.</p>

<p>“You know I couldn’t do that, Mr. Maxwell,”
he objected. “Your young man has probably
been much too close to you to make it possible or
prudent. You are a rich man yourself, and you
can very easily provide for your secretary, as I
make no doubt you will. Must you go? Don’t
be in a hurry. We needn’t make this a personal
fight, I’m sure.”</p>

<p>The ex-superintendent looked at his watch and
told a lie for the sake of keeping the peace.</p>

<p>“It is my luncheon hour,” he said. “If there
are any routine matters upon which you may wish
to consult me, you will find me over at the hotel.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</span>And he went out with his hat pulled over his eyes
and his blood boiling. To have stayed another
minute would have been to risk an explosion.</p>

<p>It was a small but exceedingly fervent indignation
meeting which gathered in Attorney Stillings’s
office in the Kinzie Building a little after twelve
o’clock on this day of cataclysms. When Maxwell
entered, Stillings was trying to explain to Starbuck
and Sprague and Editor Kendall&mdash;who had
been hauled out of bed to lend his presence to the
conference&mdash;just how it had come about.</p>

<p>As it appeared in the wrathful summing up, it
had happened very easily; so easily as to present
every indication of careful prearrangement. When
the Hixon case had been called in court, Stillings
had risen and asked for a further postponement,
having, as it chanced, a very good excuse in the
fact that the witness by whom he expected to prove
that Hixon’s claim of a lost mining sale was a pure
invention was absent. Instantly the Kentucky colonel
counsel for the plaintiff had jumped up,
not to protest against the further delay, but to
introduce his colleague in the cause&mdash;the stranger
whose name on the Hophra House register was
Mr. Peter Hunniwell.</p>

<p>Before Stillings could get his breath, Hunniwell
was on his feet, making an impassioned plea
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</span>for justice. Rapidly rehearsing the course of the
defendant railroad company, which he charged
with maliciously striving to defeat the ends of justice,
he summed up with a still more serious charge,
namely, that the railroad was not only unwilling
to pay the just claims upon it, but was unable to
do so; was, in effect, practically bankrupt, as the
thick packet of affidavits, which he here passed up
to the judge, would sufficiently prove.</p>

<p>“After that,” Stillings went on, “it was <i>biff!
bang!</i> and the fight was over. Judge Watson
merely glanced through the affidavits&mdash;which may
or may not be purely faked&mdash;while Hunniwell, in a
voice like a steam calliope, was demanding that
the court appoint a receiver. It was so ridiculous,
so absolutely beyond all precedent, that it didn’t
seem worth while to try to call him down. When
Hunniwell finally quit, the judge was looking over
his spectacles at us in that mild, half-vacant way
of his, and saying, ‘I think your point is very well
taken. It is time that something was done to
bring these defendant corporations to a sense of
their responsibilities to the plain people. I shall
appoint, as temporary receiver, Mr. C. F. Dimmock,
the appointment to take effect this day at
noon.’ At noon, mind you!” choked Stillings.
“And it was at that moment half-past eleven!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</span></p>

<p>“Of course, you tried to break in,” said Maxwell.</p>

<p>“Sure! But I might as well have gone out on
the court-house steps and shouted at the scenery!
Watson told me, in the same half-absent way, that
the receivership was only temporary, and that we
should have ample opportunity to show cause,
if we could, why the receiver should be discharged
at the regular hearing, which he there and then set
for the twelfth of the month, naming his chambers
as the place. Before I could wedge in another
word, court was adjourned and Watson was leaving
the bench.”</p>

<p>Sprague was nodding slowly.</p>

<p>“Now we know the meaning of the Sunday
track-laying, and the sudden influx of strangers&mdash;most
of whom will doubtless turn out to be T-C.
officials and employees&mdash;and the mysterious kidnapping
of the Short Line’s attorney night before
last,” he said. And then to Maxwell: “I suppose
the thing is definitely done, and you have been
properly kicked out of your office, Dick?”</p>

<p>Maxwell briefed the short interview with Dimmock
for the benefit of the others.</p>

<p>“Dimmock and Carmody are in charge,” he
concluded, “and before night they will have tried
and executed everybody in the service whose head
sticks up far enough to give them an excuse for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</span>cutting it off. They are going to make a clean
sweep. Dimmock practically admitted it. By
this time to-morrow the Nevada Short Line will be
part and parcel of the Transcontinental System,
with only T-C. men in charge.”</p>

<p>“Holy Smoke!” said Kendall, and the ejaculation
from him meant more than the most frenzied
outburst of the average man: and then again he
said, “<i>Holy Smoke!</i>”</p>

<p>It was Starbuck, himself a small stockholder in
the confiscated railroad, who first got his feet upon
the solid earth again.</p>

<p>“I reckon we-all are just going to sit around and
bite our thumbs and let these hold-ups put it all
over us,” he said, in his slow drawl; adding, after
the proper pause: “I don’t think!”</p>

<p>Maxwell sprang out of his chair.</p>

<p>“I must go to the commercial office and wire
Ford!” he broke out. “He’ll know what to do,
if there is anything that can be done. Stillings,
you get in touch with our general counsel in
Chicago. We’re an interstate road, and this thing
can’t be settled in a Timanyoni county court!”</p>

<p>“Hold on,” said Stillings. “That is where
we’re lame. We allowed ourselves to be sued in
this cause, as we have in a good many others,
under the old corporate name&mdash;The Red Butte
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</span>Western. That, as you know, was a purely intrastate
corporation. Our newer lines are only ‘extensions.’”</p>

<p>“Then we can’t carry it up to the Federal
courts?” gasped Maxwell.</p>

<p>“We can try it, and, of course, we shall try it.
But the presumptive facts are against us. What
I am hoping is that our Pacific Southwestern
backers will be able to help us make a killing and
dump these pirates at the regular hearing.”</p>

<p>“Then you needn’t hope any more,” said
Sprague quietly. “Apart from the fact that
they’ve put the high kibosh on you to-day, the
element of time comes in to cut the largest figure.
For the stock-smashing purpose in this particular
instance, a short receivership will prove as efficacious
as a long one. You’ve had one experience
with the steam-roller to-day, and you’ll have as
many more of them as may seem necessary. It
wouldn’t make any difference if you should import
a train-load of eastern lawyers; the thing’s
done, and it is going to stay done until it has accomplished
the end in view&mdash;which is to transfer
the stock control of the Short Line to the T-C.
Your only chance is to strike back, and strike
quickly&mdash;before the mischief is done in New
York.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</span></p>

<p>“But how?” pleaded Stillings. “Tell us how!”</p>

<p>“By proving clearly, what I presume we all accept
as the undoubted fact, that Judge Watson
has been bribed.”</p>

<p>True to his calling, Stillings was the first to
object to so sweeping a charge.</p>

<p>“Oh, hold on!” he exclaimed. “I wouldn’t go
so far as that. That is a pretty serious charge,
Sprague.”</p>

<p>“I know it is. But when I say bribery, it
doesn’t necessarily mean the grosser form of buying
with cash money. Let us say that Judge
Watson has been ‘influenced.’ If you can’t make
that charge and sustain it, you may as well call
the incident closed.”</p>

<p>Maxwell was leaning against the door-jamb.
His eyes were fiery and his breath was coming
quickly.</p>

<p>“If you say there has been crooked work, Calvin,
that settles it; I believe it. Now tell us
what to do, and we’ll do it.”</p>

<p>Kendall’s lean, leathery jaw was set hard, and
he was furtively watching the big expert. That
a fierce struggle of some kind was going on behind
the mask of the ruddy, half-boyish face, he made
no doubt. And Sprague’s answer quickly confirmed
the editor’s conclusion.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</span></p>
<p>“You don’t know what you’re asking, Dick,”
said the big man slowly.</p>

<p>“I do!” said Maxwell hotly. “I’m asking
you to help us send a bunch of criminals&mdash;just
low-down, ordinary thieving criminals&mdash;to jail!
Sprague, if you can do it, and <i>won’t</i> do it&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>There was a strained silence in the shabby little
law office that seemed as if it would never be
broken. Kendall turned his face away, and Starbuck
slid noiselessly out of his chair and went to
stand at the window with his back to the others.
At length the reply to Maxwell’s demand came,
wrung out, as it seemed, from the very heart of
reluctance.</p>

<p>“It can be done. Every chain that was ever
forged has its weak link. For reasons which are
purely personal to me, I’d rather be shot than go
into this thing with you. I’d refuse, if I could in
common decency; and, in any event, I may fall
down on you when it comes to the pinch. But
I’ll go as far as I can. Will that do?”</p>

<p>“Say it!” snapped the ex-superintendent
eagerly.</p>

<p>“All right. Stillings, you may come to my
room in the hotel at two o’clock, and bring Mr.
David Kinzie, our downstairs bank president,
with you if you have to club him to do it. Kendall,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</span>I’m going to ask you to make just as little
as possible of this railroad grab in your news
columns for the present, taking my word for it
that you shall have the biggest story of the year
if we win out. Starbuck, you’ll come over to the
hotel with me now, and I’ll give you your stunt.
That’s all; the meeting’s adjourned.”</p>

<p>To say that the little inter-mountain city was
stirred to the depths by the news which quickly
spread from lip to lip is putting it mildly. In
its beginnings, Brewster had been a railroad town
in the strictest sense, owing its location and its
phenomenal after-growth largely to the fostering
policy of the railroad. Under Maxwell’s wise
and just management the Nevada Short Line
had identified itself very closely with the growth
and prosperity of the entire inter-mountain region,
and it had stood as a shining example of a “good”
corporation. To have the popular management
swept ruthlessly aside and the rule of another
company, operating under the thin mask of a receivership,
set up in its place, provoked a storm
of indignant protest.</p>

<p>Moreover, many of the well-to-do citizens of the
Timanyoni were stockholders in the Short Line,
and upon these the blow fell as a disaster. Prominent
among these local stockholders stood the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</span>owner of the Kinzie Building, Brewster’s one multi-millionaire
and the president of the Brewster National
Bank. At precisely two o’clock David
Kinzie, gray and pale, and with his small ferret-like
eyes peering shrewdly from under the rim of
the soft, gray hat which he always wore, stepped
into the Hotel Topaz elevator with Stillings. It
had not been necessary for the attorney to bludgeon
him to induce him to come to the conference
with Sprague.</p>

<p>What went on behind the locked door of Room
403 after the two had been admitted was a secret
that was not shared with any fourth party, though
one of Editor Kendall’s young men promptly
waylaid Stillings at the close of the conference.</p>

<p>“Tell Mr. Kendall he shall have the news, and
have it first, when there is any,” was all the lawyer
would say; but Connabel, the star reporter
who had done the waylaying, died hard.</p>

<p>“Give me a hint, Mr. Stillings&mdash;just the barest
shadow of a hint,” he begged. “Will the case be
taken to the Federal courts?”</p>

<p>“Not for publication, Fred,” laughed the lawyer,
who was evidently in better spirits. Then
he added: “There’s a big story in this, my boy,
and you shall have it when it’s ripe; I’ll promise
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</span>you that&mdash;I’ll ask Kendall to detail you. And
that is positively all you’ll get out of me now.”</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes after the lawyer and Mr. Kinzie
had left Room 403 the door opened again,
this time to admit Starbuck.</p>

<p>“Well?” said the big-bodied expert, when Maxwell’s
brother-in-law had taken the chair recently
vacated by the banker.</p>

<p>“The judge is sick, or playing sick,” was the
answer. “Doc Mangum has just gone out to the
house, and the servants have their orders to admit
nobody.”</p>

<p>“What is the nature of his sickness? Does anybody
know that?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; it’s heart trouble and too much altitude.
He’s had it before.”</p>

<p>Sprague’s eyes narrowed and his big hands
closed in a vice-like grip on the arms of his chair.</p>

<p>“Billy, does it occur to you that this is a most
opportune time for him to be taken sick again?
What do they do for patients with heart trouble
in this country?”</p>

<p>“Order ’em down to a lower altitude,” said the
mine owner.</p>

<p>“Exactly. And we shall find that this is what
Doctor Mangum will advise in the present case.
When he does so, Judge Watson will go.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</span></p>

<p>Starbuck was deftly rolling a cigarette of dry
tobacco. “And then what?” he queried.</p>

<p>“Then the regular hearing, which is set for the
twelfth of the month, can’t be held, and the temporary
receivership will hold over until it is either
confirmed or set aside by the higher courts. In
the meantime the delay will have accomplished
its purpose. The New York bank pool of the
stock will be broken, the T-C. people will buy
it in, and the nail will be driven and clinched.”</p>

<p>Starbuck winked gravely.</p>

<p>“You’re not going to let Judge Watson get out
of town,” he predicted. “I can ride up the trail
that far without falling off.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Sprague, “we are not going to let
him get away until we are through with him.
Did you make the other arrangement I spoke
of?”</p>

<p>“I sure did. If anybody’s fool enough to let
the cat out o’ the bag, we’ll get the cat. Tarbell’s
on that part of the job.”</p>

<p>Sprague went to the wardrobe at the other end
of the room and got out his hat and a light top-coat.</p>

<p>“Yes, we’ll get the cat, Billy. The only thing
I’m afraid of is that we may get the kitten, too.
If that should happen, your Uncle Calvin might
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</span>fly the track. Let’s go. I have an appointment
to meet Judge Walsh, of the United States District
Court, at half-past three, and I’m going to
ask you to borrow Maxwell’s car and drive me
out to the judge’s house.”</p>

<p>Before nightfall of the Monday it became
plainly evident that the new management of the
Short Line had climbed fairly into the executive
saddle and was making due preparations to stay
there. As Maxwell had prophesied, Receiver Dimmock
made a clean sweep, and before the first
through train came in over the new routing a
score of minor department heads had been let
out and their places filled by T-C. men. Even
the train-despatchers were discharged; and after
dinner Maxwell held a “consolation” meeting in
the hotel club-rooms with his fired staff, and listened
patiently to the bad language which the
wholesale hardship evoked.</p>

<p>To one and all of the losers he said the same
thing, however; they were to sit tight and say
nothing for the present. It was a long lane that
had no turning, and the next turn in the Short
Line lane might not be very far distant.</p>

<p>“Just one thing, Mr. Maxwell,” Connolly, the
fat despatcher, put in, as the meeting was about
to break up. “If you’ll tell us that Mr. Scientific
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</span>Sprague is with us I guess we’ll all sleep better
to-night.”</p>

<p>“He is,” said Maxwell. “That’s all for the
present. Just sit tight and don’t talk. Go home
and take your lay-off. If we win out, you’re all
under pay, just the same as if you were on the
job.”</p>

<p>It was late that night, after Maxwell had gone
to his room, that the long-delayed word came from
New York. Maxwell read the telegram from
President Ford, and, late as it was, took it immediately
to Sprague’s room, which was on the
floor below. The expert got out of bed to admit
him, and read the few type-written lines thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“He puts it up to you good and hard, doesn’t
he?” was his comment. “But that is about what
I expected. He is up to his neck in the fight to
keep those lending bankers from dumping the
majority stock and running around in circles.
Go to the wire and tell him to keep a stiff upper
lip; that you’re not dead yet. Also, you might
add that Kinzie’s backing him with those
bankers.”</p>

<p>“By Jove!” said Maxwell. “Was that what
you wanted Kinzie for to-day?”</p>

<p>“It was one of the things. Get your message in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</span>so that Ford will have it in the morning. Good-night.”</p>

<p>With the opening of the second day the Brewster
excitement had died down to some extent, and the
new railroad routine was getting itself shaken into
the working rut. On every hand it was evident
that the coup had been carefully planned long in
advance. Almost without a break the through
service was established over the new routing, and
a hard-and-fast law was laid down for the Short
Line rank and file employees, the vast majority of
whom were retained under the receivership. The
law briefly exacted loyalty to the new management.
There would be no more removals except
for cause; but anything less than a hearty acceptance
of the court order would be considered sufficient
cause for prompt dismissal.</p>

<p>Copies of the receiver’s circulars and general
orders found their way quickly to Maxwell, and the
firm, strong hand of authority appeared in every
line of them. How Sprague would go about it
to break down the wall of possession which every
hour was building higher and stronger, was a puzzle
as yet unsolved; and it was not until the forenoon
of the Wednesday that the various burrowings
which the expert had set afoot began to yield
results.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</span></p>

<p>Tarbell brought the first of the results to the
lobby of the Topaz at eleven o’clock on this third
day in the shape of a note from Banker Kinzie.
Hixon, the suing bauxite miner, had received his
ten thousand dollars from somebody, and had deposited
it in the bank.</p>

<p>Sprague passed the note to Maxwell, who came
in just as Tarbell was leaving.</p>

<p>“That’s good news, in a way,” said the expert.
“It tells us that the paymaster has begun to get
busy. Any further word from Starbuck?”</p>

<p>“I saw him about half an hour ago. He says
that Judge Watson’s condition remains the same,
and Doctor Mangum makes no secret of the fact
that he has ordered him to a lower altitude. I
had another message from Ford this morning.
He says we are dying by inches at the New
York end, and the final smash may come at any
minute.”</p>

<p>“We’ve got to have a little time,” was the quiet
rejoinder. “The trap is baited and set, Dick,
but we can’t very well spring it ourselves. Any
word from Mr. Dimmock?”</p>

<p>“Not to me, no.”</p>

<p>Sprague’s smile was mirthless. “I haven’t
escaped so easily,” he asserted. “Mr. Dimmock
came over to my rooms this morning after breakfast
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</span>and read me a carefully expurgated edition of
the riot act. Translated into plain English, what
he said was to the effect that my Government job
wouldn’t be worth much to me if I meddled in this
railroad jangle.”</p>

<p>“Then he knows you?”</p>

<p>“He knows of two or three things that I have
done in the reasoning line, and&mdash;well, I’m inclined
to think that he is a little nervous about something.
He went so far as to hint that he had reason
to believe that his mail had been tampered
with.”</p>

<p>“What? He didn’t charge you with anything
like that, did he?” demanded Maxwell, in generous
indignation.</p>

<p>“Oh, no; not personally, of course. He merely
intimated that, as an officer of the court, he
wouldn’t stand for any interference.”</p>

<p>Maxwell was silent for a time. Then he said:
“What are you waiting for, Calvin?&mdash;more evidence?”</p>

<p>“No; I’m waiting for the click of the trap, and
a word from the man who is watching it.”</p>

<p>“Will the trap be sprung?”</p>

<p>“It will. Twice since yesterday there have been
nibbles at the bait, and both times the nibbler has
been afraid.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</span></p>

<p>“Watson, you mean?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“What is he afraid of?”</p>

<p>“A man with heart trouble is afraid of many
things.”</p>

<p>Maxwell put an unlighted cigar in his mouth
and began to chew on it absently.</p>

<p>“Dimmock’s daughter is here. Did you know
that?”</p>

<p>The big-bodied chemistry expert was staring
fixedly at the revolving street door which was
whirling slowly to admit a group of passengers
from the lately arrived Red Butte accommodation.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know that he had a daughter; or
rather I do know that he hasn’t one. He was
married only three or four years ago,” he returned
half-absently.</p>

<p>“That’s where you’re off wrong,” retorted the
railroad man. “He certainly has one, and she is
here; she was at breakfast with him when I came
down this morning. She is so distractingly pretty
that I couldn’t believe she was the daughter of
that hard-featured piece of financial machinery
which is running our railroad. So I asked the
head-waiter. He said she was Mr. Dimmock’s
daughter.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</span></p>

<p>“It’s a mistake,” insisted Sprague. Then he
changed the subject abruptly, rising and buttoning
his coat. “I have an appointment that I’ve
got to keep, and I may not get away for a couple
of hours. Meet me here for a one o’clock luncheon.
If I make the point I’m going to try to make,
you’ll be needed.”</p>

<p>When he was left alone, Maxwell did his best to
kill time easily and to possess his soul in patience.
The inaction of the past two days had been a keen
agony, unrelieved by any glimpse into the mysterious
depths in which Sprague, after his usual
fashion, was groping alone.</p>

<p>Was it possible that Sprague could reason out a
way of escape for the captured Short Line? For
the hundredth time Maxwell went over the well-intrenched
position of the enemy, searching vainly
for the weak point in the lines which had been so
swiftly and surely drawn about the confiscated
property. Every legal requirement had been astutely
met, and the law itself seemed to bar the
way to any attempt at recovery. True, Judge
Watson had grossly misused the authority given
him by his high office, but the equity of his act
could be questioned only in the courts; questioned,
and set aside, it might be, but too late to save the
bewildered and panic-stricken stockholders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</span></p>

<p>Lighting the dry cigar, Maxwell got up to stroll
to the clerk’s desk. The register lay open on the
counter, and he absently read the later signatures.
Among them there was a woman’s name, written
in a firm, bold hand, and lacking the identifying
“Miss” or “Mrs.” “Diana Carswell” was the
name, and in the place-column was written, “New
York.”</p>

<p>Maxwell’s teeth met in the centre of the newly
lighted cigar when he saw the signature. He did
not know Miss Carswell, truly, but all the world
knew of her, and the masculine half of it, at least,
was wont to wax eloquent over her beauty, her
accomplishments, and her vast wealth. Maxwell
remembered vaguely of hearing that her father
was dead, and that the Carswell many-millions
had been left to the mother and daughter; also
that Miss Carswell was the niece of a still larger
fortune&mdash;namely, that of the great captain of
finance whom he and Ford had all along credited
with the planning of the raids made on the Nevada
Short Line.</p>

<p>Here was food for reflection, plenty of it. What
was Miss Diana Carswell doing in Brewster, which
was as far apart from her world as if it had been
the smallest village on an alien planet? Curiously
Maxwell scanned the register for other names
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</span>which might answer the query. There were none.
Miss Carswell was alone, or at least she was not
accompanied by any other New Yorkers. It was
another mystery, and the ex-superintendent was
growing sensitive in his mystery nerve. Possibly
Sprague&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Sprague came in a few minutes before one
o’clock, and there was a grim set to his big jaw
that Maxwell had seen there more than once on
the foot-ball field when the game was desperate.</p>

<p>“We’ll eat first,” was the incomer’s crisp dictum.
“Shall we go in now?”</p>

<p>Together they went to the café, taking their
accustomed table in the far corner of the many-pillared
room. At the serving of the bouillon,
Maxwell broke out.</p>

<p>“Up to a certain point, Calvin, I can blunder
along in the dark with my eyes shut, and do it
more or less cheerfully. But past that point&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I know; it has been rather hard on you, Dick.
But the suspense is nearly over. At two o’clock
we are due in Judge Walsh’s chambers in the
Federal Building, and you will then learn all you
need to know&mdash;and possibly a good bit more.
You’ll have to forgive me for fogging you up as I
went along. I guess that is part of the detective
slant in me; to want to go my own way, and to go
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</span>it alone. The minute I begin to talk over the
reasoning process with somebody else I begin to
lose the keen sense of values. Writer people have
told me that the same thing is true of plotting and
novelling.”</p>

<p>Maxwell smiled grimly. “Speaking of novel
plots, I hit upon the start for a good one this forenoon&mdash;just
after you went away. I was glancing
over the hotel register and I saw a name there that
was full of all sorts of mysteries and plotting suggestions.”</p>

<p>“Whose name?” queried the expert.</p>

<p>“I’m going to devil you for a while now, and
let you find out for yourself,” laughed the railroad
man. “I don’t know the owner of the name,
and I don’t suppose you do; but I’ll bet a piebald
pinto worth fifty dollars that, when you see what
I saw, you’ll sit up and take notice and do a little
stunt of wondering that will make mine look like a
cheap imitation.”</p>

<p>The big man grinned good-naturedly.</p>

<p>“Rub it in,” he said. “I don’t wonder that
you are getting a bit collar-sore. But don’t forget
to eat. Two o’clock is the time, you know.
And, by the way, I hope you haven’t failed to keep
in touch with the various members of your staff&mdash;the
men whom Dimmock was in such an indecent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</span>hurry to discharge. We may need their help a
little later.”</p>

<p>Maxwell told circumstantially what had been
done, and from that the table-talk slipped easily
into a discussion of human loyalty in the abstract,
and so continued until the waiter brought the
cigars. Sprague was looking at his watch as they
made their way among the well-filled tables toward
the door, and it was in the midst of a sentence
pointing to the need for haste to keep the two
o’clock appointment that he found Maxwell halting
him.</p>

<p>Now it may say itself that a man may be a very
Solon among reasoners and a modern Vidocq in the
fine art of unravelling mysteries, without in the
least approaching the type which is so aptly described
by the slang phrase, “Johnnie-on-the-spot.”
When Sprague dropped his watch back into its
pocket he found himself halted beside a table at
which were seated the cold-featured, accurately
groomed chief raider of the captured railroad, and
a young woman whose radiant beauty was bedazzling
more eyes than those of the interested
on-lookers at the surrounding tables.</p>

<p>Sprague looked, lost himself, and then came
slowly back to earth in the realization that Dimmock
was speaking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</span></p>

<p>“Excuse me, Mr. Maxwell,” he was saying:
“I wanted you to meet my daughter. Diana,
this is Mr. Richard Maxwell, whose wife is one of
the Fairbairn girls, you know, and Mr. Maxwell’s
friend, Mr. Sprague, of the Department of Agriculture.”</p>

<p>It was the young woman herself who broke in.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; Mr. Sprague and I have met before;
haven’t we, Mr. Sprague?” with a mocking smile
for Sprague’s benefit. And then: “We’ve been
missing you at Topaz Tepees. Have you been
finding it too far to ride?”</p>

<p>What the athletic chemistry expert managed
to stammer out in reply, what he went on saying
to Miss Carswell during the fraction of a minute
or so that Dimmock was holding Maxwell in talk,
he could not remember a single second after the
swinging together of the glass doors which shut
them out of the dining-room. That was because
the astounding discovery was still crippling him
to blot out all the intermediate details.</p>

<p>But one large fact stood clear in the confusing
medley. Clutching Maxwell’s arm he shoved him
headlong into the near-by writing-room, which was
opportunely deserted.</p>

<p>“Richard, I’m out of it!” he gasped hoarsely.
“Dimmock knew what card to play, and he has
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</span>played it. My Lord! Why didn’t I guess that
the Mrs. Carswell he married four years ago was
Diana’s mother? I didn’t guess it; it never entered
my mind! I knew Diana was a niece of
the chief wrecker&mdash;the man we’ve been after all
summer; I found that out last week, and that was
why I told you I couldn’t stay with you. And
now: oh, dammit, dammit, <i>dammit</i>!”</p>

<p>“Take it easy, old man,” said Maxwell soothingly;
“and remember that as yet I’m only groping
around the edges. What is it that Dimmock
has done to you?”</p>

<p>“Heavens and earth! don’t you see? For Diana’s
sake I’ve monkeyed and schemed and side-stepped
on this receivership business until I’ve
got it in shape to pull you out without pulling her
uncle in. But to do that, I’ve put Dimmock, her
step-father, so deep in the hole that a yoke of oxen
couldn’t haul him out! He knows it, too; and
that was the reason for that bit of by-play just
now at the luncheon-table. He was saying to me
in just so many words, ‘Now you know who you’re
hitting; go ahead, if you dare!’”</p>

<p>“And, naturally, since Miss Carswell is the one
altogether lovely, you don’t dare. I can’t blame
you, Calvin. Drop it, and we’ll do the best we
can without you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</span></p>

<p>Sprague was walking the floor of the little
writing-room with his big hands jammed deep in
the pockets of his short business coat. Suddenly
he stopped and smacked a huge fist into a hollowed
palm.</p>

<p>“By George, Dick, we’ll do it yet!” he broke
out. “I’ll beat him at his own game&mdash;come on!”
And again seizing the railroad man’s arm, he
dragged him out of the hotel and almost flung
him into the nearest waiting taxicab.</p>

<p>The order to the cab-driver ran to the Brewster
National Bank; and two minutes later Sprague,
with Maxwell at his heels, shouldered his way
through a group of waiting customers to the president’s
room. Gray old David Kinzie was at his
desk, and he nodded toward a door in the opposite
wall of the business office leading to the isolated
directors’ room. “Stillings and Hunniwell are
in there,” he said, “and Starbuck has gone after
the culprit.”</p>

<p>“And the other man?” queried Sprague sharply.</p>

<p>“He didn’t want to come, but he will. He
thinks it is a conference to discuss the bank’s attitude,
and he doesn’t want to commit himself. I
convinced him that he’d better come.”</p>

<p>Again Sprague led the way, pausing at the inner
door, however, to push Maxwell in ahead of him.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</span>The two lawyers were sitting opposite each other
at the far end of the long committee table which
filled the centre of the room; and their greetings
to the new-comers were wordless. Maxwell had
scarcely taken the chair next to Stillings when the
door opened again, this time to admit a stoop-shouldered,
thin-haired man whose face was even
grayer than Banker Kinzie’s. This last arrival
was Judge Watson, and when he saw Sprague and
Maxwell he would have withdrawn, only Starbuck
was behind him to make it impossible.</p>

<p>As before, the greetings were merely nodded;
and a silence that could be felt settled down upon
the room. It was the judge who broke it first.</p>

<p>“I think I have made a mistake, gentlemen,”
he began. “I was expecting to meet Mr.&mdash;ah&mdash;er&mdash;a
gentleman who is not here.”</p>

<p>The words were hardly out of his mouth before
the door was opened for the third time, and Dimmock,
closely followed by Kinzie, entered. Like
the judge, the receiver would have withdrawn
when he saw the group around the table; but
again Starbuck intervened, this time to shut the
door and to stand with his back against it.</p>

<p>At the click of the latch, Sprague rose ponderously
in his place at the head of the table.</p>

<p>“Sit down, Mr. Dimmock,” he directed.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</span>“This is a little business meeting preliminary to
another and more important one, and our time is
exceedingly limited.”</p>

<p>The receiver looked sharply at the speaker.
“My time is much more limited than yours, Mr.
Sprague,” he retorted crisply. “I shall have to
ask you to excuse me.”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” said Sprague suavely, “if you
wish it. But in that case, I must tell you that Mr.
Starbuck, who is standing just behind you, has
been properly sworn in as a United States deputy
marshal, and he will promptly take you into custody
on a charge of conspiracy.”</p>

<p>If the chemistry expert had suddenly rolled a
bomb, with the fuse lighted, down the length of the
long table, the sensation could scarcely have been
greater or more startling. Dimmock took a backward
step and put up his hands as if to ward off
a blow; and Hunniwell, the imported attorney,
sprang to his feet as if his chair had been suddenly
electrified.</p>

<p>“What’s this?” he stormed. “This is not a
court of law! I demand that that door be opened!
We cannot be held in duress!”</p>

<p>“Sit down!” said Sprague shortly. “Mr. Dimmock
is your client, and you are here, not to defend
him, but to advise him. As to the duress you’re
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</span>so much afraid of, I’ll say this: I am going to make
one short statement of facts. After you have
heard it, if you and your client wish to withdraw,
the door will be opened.”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I am ill,” said the judge weakly, and he
made a motion to rise from his chair. Kinzie
grimly poured out a glass of water from the pitcher
on the table and gave it to him without comment,
while Dimmock took the chair Starbuck was offering
him and sat down.</p>

<p>“I’ll be very brief, gentlemen,” Sprague went
on, taking out his watch and laying it on the table.
“The facts are these. There has been a conspiracy
entered into for the purpose of depriving the
stockholders of the railroad known as the Nevada
Short Line of their property under a form of law.
That purpose has apparently succeeded, but I
have here”&mdash;taking a packet of papers from his
pocket&mdash;“documentary evidence inculpating various
and sundry persons who figure as the conspirators.
Three of these persons are here in this
room. In another room, namely, in Judge Walsh’s
chambers in the Federal Building, there is waiting
another and quite informal gathering: it is composed
of the leading members of the Bar Association
of the Timanyoni District, and it is presided
over by Judge Walsh. It is assembled to prevent,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</span>if possible, one of the greatest scandals that
has ever threatened the fair name of the courts of
this State.”</p>

<p>“I object!” shouted Hunniwell, struggling to
his feet again; and this time Sprague pushed him
back into his chair without ceremony.</p>

<p>“To this statement of fact,” the self-appointed
chairman continued, quite as if there had been no
interruption, “we will add a demand and impose
an alternative. The demand is that the railroad
be turned over to its rightful owners at once. If
it is not complied with, you, Judge Watson, and
you, Mr. Dimmock, and you, Mr. Hunniwell”&mdash;indicating
each in turn with a squarely pointed
forefinger&mdash;“may choose your alternative: which
is to go with me to Judge Walsh’s chambers, where
I shall lay before the gentlemen there assembled
this packet of evidence.”</p>

<p>“It’s a bluff!” yelled the attorney for the defence.
“Do you think we’re going to be taken in
by any such flim-flam as that? We’ll call your
bluff, you damned amateur! You don’t dare to
show up that evidence here!”</p>

<p>Sprague looked down with a good-natured grin
upon the red-headed lawyer. Then he dropped
the packet of papers on the table in front of Hunniwell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</span></p>

<p>“I’ll stay with you,” he said quietly. “Read
for yourself. Those are only copies, however. The
originals are locked up in Judge Walsh’s safe.”</p>

<p>Hunniwell ran through the papers hurriedly and
the color came and went in his florid face. Dimmock
was staring straight ahead of him at nothing,
and his shapely fingers were beating a nervous
tattoo on the arm of his chair. The judge had
sunk into a shapeless heap in the easy chair he
had chosen and his face was ashen.</p>

<p>At the end of his hasty examination of the
papers, Hunniwell looked up, and Stillings, who
sat opposite, saw defeat in his eyes.</p>

<p>“If I could speak to Mr. Dimmock and Judge
Watson in private&mdash;” he suggested; and Sprague
nodded. There was a small ante-room at the
right of the larger directors’ room, and the three
withdrew, the attorney lending the judge a much-needed
arm.</p>

<p>Almost immediately the conferees returned,
and Hunniwell acted as spokesman.</p>

<p>“You’ve turned the trick, Mr. Sprague, for this
one time,” he said briefly, “but only because one
man&mdash;a sick man&mdash;cannot stand the pressure&mdash;which
is doubtless what you figured on. Judge
Watson will rescind his order at once, and the
road will be turned over to its former management&mdash;on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</span>one condition; that you surrender the original
papers which you say are locked up in Judge
Walsh’s safe.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Sprague instantly. “The condition
does not stand. Stillings, get Judge Walsh
on the ’phone, will you?”</p>

<p>That was enough. Hunniwell quickly withdrew
the condition; or, rather, he modified it,
lawyer-wise.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” he cut in hastily. “We’ll
waive that, with this proviso&mdash;that you’ll put the
papers into Mr. Kinzie’s hands, to be destroyed
in the presence of such witnesses as we each may
choose, after we shall have proved that we have
acted in good faith. Do you agree to that?”</p>

<p>Sprague nodded, and Starbuck stepped aside
and opened the door leading out through the banker’s
office. At the upper end of the table, Maxwell
and Stillings and the gray-faced bank president
were all trying to shake hands with Sprague at
one and the same moment; and when Hunniwell
had led the tremulous judge away, Dimmock
walked the length of the table and took his turn.
Stillings, being Western-bred, anticipated violence;
but instead of falling upon the big-bodied
ex-athlete, Dimmock, too, held out his hand.</p>

<p>“Mr. Sprague, you’ve outgeneraled us,” he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</span>said, with more frankness than his hard-lined face
and austere manner promised, even as a possibility.
“Diana tells me that you are wedded to your
Government position, and if that is so, you are
simply throwing yourself away. Come to New
York, and we’ll put you in the way of doing something
worth while.” Then he added, with the
charming smile he seemed to be able to summon at
will: “You played a finer game than I thought
you would; in fact, I thought I had trumped your
ace to-day at the luncheon-table.”</p>

<p>“You did&mdash;mighty nearly,” laughed the big
one. And then to Stillings: “Robert, will you go
over to Judge Walsh’s chambers and tell the
gentlemen who are waiting there&mdash;well, tell them
what is necessary. You’ll know how.”</p>

<p>But Dimmock was not to be so easily turned
aside.</p>

<p>“I say you played it fine,” he repeated, still
amiable. “You knew that, under the circumstances,
the&mdash;er&mdash;sentimental circumstances, we
may call them&mdash;you couldn’t afford to go before
that larger committee with your evidence, Mr.
Sprague.”</p>

<p>Sprague’s mellow laugh rang in the empty room.</p>

<p>“Just now I am the prisoner at the bar, Mr.
Dimmock, and I’m not obliged to incriminate myself,”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</span>he retorted jokingly. And at that the three
who remained went out through the banker’s office
together. On the sidewalk Dimmock paused for
one other word; the word which had been at the
bottom of his friendly approach to Sprague.</p>

<p>“Diana knows nothing of this?” he said.</p>

<p>“Nothing more than you have told her,” said
Sprague.</p>

<p>“And that is less than nothing,” was the prompt
return. After which they separated, Dimmock
going up the street toward Hunniwell’s hotel,
Maxwell hurrying off to the telegraph office to
wire the good news to Ford, and Sprague sauntering
slowly back to the Hotel Topaz, wondering if,
by any hook or crook of good fortune, he should be
lucky enough to find Miss Diana Carswell disengaged
and willing to accord him an hour or so of
an afternoon which was still young.</p>

<p>It was in the evening of the same day, after Maxwell
had been reinstalled in his office by order of
the court, and the summarily discharged staff had
been reinstated, that the superintendent turned
upon Sprague, who was sitting, as his evening custom
was, in the easiest of the office chairs, puffing
at a black cigar, and with his gaze fixed upon the
disused gas chandelier marking the exact centre
of the ceiling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</span></p>

<p>“How did you do it, Calvin?” came the abrupt
demand from Maxwell’s corner. “Did you really
have any evidence against Miss Diana’s step-father
and her uncle?”</p>

<p>The big-bodied man from Washington chuckled
softly.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; I had the evidence. There was a
hitch between Watson and Dimmock, and they
were both of them injudicious enough to send notes
back and forth; notes which, by the help of two
good friends of yours and mine, were intercepted,
carefully copied, the originals preserved, and the
copies forwarded. It was a little off-color, but
when you are fighting the devil you can’t always
stop to pick your weapons. Watson was to have
a Federal judgeship, and Big Money was to see
that he got it. The hitch came in reference to
Watson’s leaving town. He was afraid to go;
afraid of public sentiment; and Dimmock was
holding him on the rack. I don’t know whether
the evidence of the letters would have held in an
ordinary court, but I do know that I had Judge
Walsh on my side.”</p>

<p>Maxwell whirled around in his chair.</p>

<p>“Sprague, did those letters incriminate Dimmock
and Miss Diana’s uncle?”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t let’s say ‘incriminate’; let’s use the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</span>milder word, ‘inculpate’. Yes, I guess they did,
Dick.”</p>

<p>“Now I’ve got you!” snapped the square-shouldered
one at the desk. “You would never&mdash;never
in this wide world&mdash;have let that evidence
get out. You know you wouldn’t!”</p>

<p>The big man was grinning affably. “You’re
only half right,” he rejoined. “Up to luncheon-time
to-day I meant to do it; I had it framed up
so that the uncle, who is really the high spellbinder
of the entire push, could slip out and the
whole load would come down on Mr. Dimmock’s
shoulders. But that luncheon play queered me,
and I had to think quick to invent a new way out.
It worked, and that’s all there is to it; all but one
little item&mdash;Miss Diana let me drive her out to
Lake Topaz this afternoon, and I stole your car to
do it.”</p>

<p>“No; there is one other little item,” said Maxwell,
rising and closing his desk upon the evening’s
work. “I wired Ford, as you know, and I
gave you the credit that belonged to you&mdash;which
you may not know. Our New York crowd is
properly grateful, and they promptly wired Kinzie.
I don’t know how you’re fixed, Calvin, but
I guess this won’t come amiss if you’re going to
try to marry Diana Carswell,” and he handed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</span>Sprague a slip of paper which bore Banker Kinzie’s
promise to pay ten thousand dollars to the order
of one Calvin Sprague.</p>

<p>Sprague took the draft, glanced at the figure of
it, and handed it back with another of his deep-chested
laughs.</p>

<p>“Where on top of earth did you get the idea
that I needed money, Dick?” he asked. “Why,
Lord love you! didn’t you know that my California
uncle, Uncle William, died five years ago
and left me more money than I know what to do
with? It’s the solemn fact, and I’m working on
the Government job purely and simply because
I don’t know how to loaf comfortably&mdash;never did.
Of course, I can’t quite match up with the Carswell
millions; but if that were the only thing in the
way&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“What is the other thing?” demanded Maxwell,
in mock solicitude.</p>

<p>Sprague had risen and was stretching his arms
over his head and yawning sleepily.</p>

<p>“If you’d see me step on the scales, you wouldn’t
ask. I’m such a whale of a man, Dick! And,
say: did you notice her at table to-day? ‘Pretty,’
you’d say, but that isn’t the word; it’s ‘dainty’,
dainty in every look and move and touch. Imagine
a girl like that saying, ‘Yes, honey,’ to a great
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</span>big overgrown stale foot-ball artist like me! Let’s
go over to the house and smoke a bedtime. Nobody
loves me, and I’m going out in the garden to
eat&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That is what makes you so frightfully fat&mdash;you
eat too many of the fuzzy kind,” laughed the
snappy little superintendent unsympathetically.
And then he flicked the switch of the office lights
and they went out together into the calm September
night.</p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project

        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
